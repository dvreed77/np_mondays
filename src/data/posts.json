To make this idea creatively competitive, High-Flying Homework will involve everyone in each tribe in an welcoming way, but there will be a clear winner in the end\u2026 Also, someone may end up jumping from a plane or helicopter for the win.\n\n**HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT RULES**:  \n**1**. Post a photo of yourself wearing your [#GrassrootsGear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilVXLuWn2jc) completely suspended in air to **your respective November Project Facebook wall**. Yes, selfies _are_ allowed but your audience will be specifically looking to see that you\u2019re _not_ hanging, dangling, or balancing. \u201cHigh-Flying\u201d means fully suspended in air.  \n**2**. Again, post your photos to your tribe\u2019s Facebook wall. Twitter, Instagram, or even Snapchat are all awesome, however **we\u2019re going to gather the pics that are officially posted to Facebook only**.  \n**3**. Photos will only be evaluated if they\u2019re posted between Wednesday 4/30, 6:29AM and Wednesday 5/7, 6:29AM and tagged #HighFlyingHomework.\n\nAfter each member has turned in his or her homework, each set of co-leaders will identify the most **LIKE**\u2018d photo of their tribe and pass it on to the mothership tribe here in Boston. We\u2019ll post the album with every tribe\u2019s winning photo and sit back and see which photo is the strongest in North America. The winner of the overall contest with the most LIKE\u2019s from the mothership album will win a flight to Boston to train at Harvard Stadium this summer (If the winner is from Boston then we\u2019ll be flying you directly to Downtown Indianapolis).\n\nSee some examples below and read about what they\u2019re missing\u2026\n\nEven though [Esther Lofgren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMewPPY9C9E) (above) is an Olympic Gold medalist from the London Games in 2012 she would get an F+ on this photo if she\u2019d posted it for High-Flying homework. You see, the boat gliding through the water is not High-Flying. If she\u2019d have traded water and rowing for air and totally flying\u2026 she\u2019d have gotten a much higher grade.

But, if she were to turn it in as High-Flying homework she\u2019d get a D- as best.

Lauren (left in photo) has experience in this town and is ready to set her sights on the marathon, even though she will not be racing this Monday. Wait no longer, here is Lauren\u2019s letter to Boston\u2026\n\n_Dear Boston,_\n\nMy love affair with you began when I was 17 years old. A high school junior looking into college options. I was ready to leave my small town and venture into a big city. And you were it. From the minute I stepped off the plane at Logan, I knew.  \nI spent the next 6 years exploring every corner, T station, and (let\u2019s be honest) bar. I made amazing, life long friends, discovered a love for distance running, and even studied enough to graduate with not one, but two degrees (thank you Northeastern).  \nI witnessed 2 Red Sox World Series Championships, a few flipped cars during Patriots riots, and was even able to run the Boston Marathon. At the time, I didn\u2019t realize the significance of these events, or how unique to Boston they were. It\u2019s just the way things were.\n\nFast forward to 2013. Long, cold winters have been left behind for endless summers, Patriots football games are watched at 10AM, and those Northeastern degrees are being put to good use. April 15th was a normal day for most people in San Diego. But all I could talk about that morning was how it was my favorite day of the year in Boston: Marathon Monday. Whether running it or cheering from that same corner on Boylston Street, it was a day incomparable to anything else. As I walked into that patient\u2019s house and saw the first reports of the bombings, all I felt was numb. I didn\u2019t even realize I was crying until my poor, confused patient handed me a tissue. This can\u2019t happen to Boston, to my city. It just can\u2019t.  \nBut it did. In the weeks after, I watched a city come together like never before. And I realized that even if you leave Boston, Boston never leaves you. It becomes entwined in your soul, your being.  \nI had heard of NP by then, and over the next few months went from curiosity about what it was, to jealousy that I wasn\u2019t in Boston to participate, to finally \u201cFuck it, I\u2019m starting a chapter here.\u201d  \nWhy? Because every city can use a November Project. A piece of the strength and community that both NP and Boston have come to represent. A place to come together, to hug, and to make real, human connections.  \nSo thank you Boston. Thank you for allowing me to spend 6 unforgettable years in your city, for birthing this amazing phenomenon we call November Project, and for showing the world the true meaning of spirit, even in the darkest of times.  \nThank you from myself, from my tribe, and from the city of San Diego. You\u2019ve given us a piece of you and we cherish it always.\n\nLove,  \nLP\n\nP.S. 2015 Boston Marathon \u2013 you and I have a date.

This is the time when we get to cheer on ALL those amazing people that are running to win, running to beat their previous personal best, running to raise money for a charity, or just running because they love moving. This is the time we donate our day off from work to pass out paper cups of water or gatorade, and a word of encouragement to a stranger that\u2019s dealing with extreme exhaustion.

Well, as luck would have it, BG and Bojan have [nurtured this continent-wide movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuzbhgkl73U), and hell, if you get creative, you can figure out how to make work travel coincide with NP tribes!\n\nBut it\u2019s even more than that. You see, as a world traveler, I\u2019ve been in plenty of places where I\u2019ve felt a little out of my element \u2013 try Casablanca \u2013 it\u2019s NOT like you saw in the movie  or Ukraine these days (what a trip). Most times and places I\u2019m pretty comfortable in my own skin wherever I am, but all too often, I have to be out of town, and usually the travel is solo. Hell, that\u2019s why Hard Rock and Starbucks stores do so well. It\u2019s a taste of home wherever you go. Well, guess what? It\u2019s the same with November Project!\n\nI\u2019ve had the good fortune to manage my work travel to visit several tribes recently such as [San Diego](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSioHTzhJOs) and [Washington DC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KfAa1Ymjyc) just this week, and sure, that BG booming voice is one of a kind, but going to these other tribes is just like being home (and even better than visiting family because you\u2019re not fighting about who sleeps on the couch). Hugs from family you\u2019ve never met before and a warm, welcoming, comforting feeling of familiarity, even if you only met these people 5 minutes ago.\n\nNow, it takes a little work and a bunch of dedication, but sooooo worth it. You know the when. Blogs tell you the where. Sending a FB message always helps to get you going. But getting there? What cities\u2019 trains run at what hours, can you finagle your work travel to stay at a hotel within reasonable distance (And no excuses, even driving in for 45 mins is worth it, trust me), rejiggering your meeting schedules in the morning (after all, someone is paying for you to visit the other tribes, better make sure you do what they\u2019re paying you to be there for ;-), finding a place to park nearby if you need to drive (Hello, Lincoln Memorial) can all tempt even the most diehard NP\u2019ers to leave out the verbal and just go to the hotel gym. But it is all of this planning and figuring out how, when and where in unfamiliar cities that makes it even more worthwhile. \n\nSeeing new faces, just as happy to have you there as you are to be there, warm welcomes, new ways to torture the human body and have fun at the same time makes you feel right at home. I\u2019ve had the good fortune to meet Lauren and crew from San Diego, Dan and Steve and a wonderful crowd at our nation\u2019s capital (I\u2019ve been itching to say that), and even there, meeting Sydney, the ringleader of the Baltimore tribe whom I\u2019m bringing out to Brookline next Friday! With the travel I\u2019ve got to do, and how much I miss Frogman1\u2019s, In and Outs, Tours, Hills and Destination Decks, I can always find where to get my fill of Memorials and sunrises and I can\u2019t wait for the trips to San Fran, Philly, LA, my old stomping grounds of NYC and as many others as I can finagle trips for. \n\nThe familiar Good Mornings, Birthday song mangling and mashups, Booms, Fuck Yeahs, and hugs from as-yet unmet family are even warmer than staying under that blanket on chilly mornings. The tribe IS strong, is everywhere, and it\u2019s ALL home.\n\nI am the Wandering Tribesman, seeking out November Project Tribes wherever life takes me.

Instead, I opted to run the Napa Valley marathon for its net downhill course and copious amounts of wine offered at the finish. As of April 14, 2013, I was a retired marathoner. The long distance never quite suited my 800 meter legs and I absolutely despise all GU\u2019s, gooze and Goo\u2019s. But on April 15, \u201cnever\u201d became \u201cnext year\u201d and \u201cwon\u2019t\u201d became \u201cwill.\u201d\n\nThis letter is not what you think. I knew no one injured in last year\u2019s bombings at the Boston Marathon. None of my friends lost their lives that day. None of my family members lost a limb, lost blood, or even lost their balance. But not everyone was as lucky as me. Two Hundred and Sixty Four innocent people were injured when the bombs exploded. Three died. A full year may have passed, but the survivors still fight every day to overcome physical hurdles, stifle their fear, and continue moving forward. Watching the city I call home unite and support one another in the days after this tragedy from my new home 3,000 miles away was both heartwarming and torturous. The West coast love was powerful as they projected BOSTON STRONG on all public transportation vehicles for months after. They organized races, used social media to send messages of sympathy, and held numerous fundraisers for the survivors and their families. Yet, even with this outpouring generosity, I still felt a gapping hole from this shear act of terror. Boston is one of the most beloved cities in the world, but only the people who have lived there truly know the fortitude built in those cobblestone sidewalks. Only Bostonians really know what it\u2019s like to walk outside on a 15 degree winter day and get smacked in the face with a 40 mph head wind\u2026and keep on walking. Only Bostonians know that chill down your spine you feel when you hear the crack of a bat followed by a roar of applause from Fenway Park on a warm Summer night. Only Bostonians know that the street meat on Landsdowne street is even better than some 5 course meals. Only Bostonians know the absolute magic of Marathon Monday, and how in one quick motion of pure evil, someone attempted to take it away from us.\n\nBut they failed.\n\nThis year I will be one of the 36,000 runners out there honoring both the victims and survivors of last year\u2019s attack. But rather than checking my watch for mile splits, instead you may notice me stopping at mile 10 to thank the water station volunteers on that long stretch of sunny asphalt. Or on mile 18 to dance and hug my November Project tribe. Or on mile 26.19 to take a moment to remember those we have lost, and those who are still working every day to regain the normalcy we so often take for granted. Boston, I have watched with incredible pride as you resurrected from the ashes, stood as one against terror, and emerged on the other side, stronger than ever before. And on April 21, 2014, Marathon Monday will return to the calendar again as one of the most joyous days of the year, with the worst of our days behind us.\n\nWith your head held high and your feet swift below, I wish all my runners the race of their life.

Significant number of our members from Boston and other #Turbo15 cities will be involved in these activities in one way or the other. Since we still want to see our marathoners at all our workouts, we decided to make this week less intense in preparation for Marathon Monday. This morning was an example of that. It wasn\u2019t really clear if we were doing 50/50 or 100/100 but one things we\u2019re 100% positive about is that we\u2019re alive and well despite some threats coming from the pissed off neighbors.

I got done early on Sunday, around 4:35. I had a 7:30 p.m. Amtrak ticket back to Boston on train #132 to South Station. But I knew the next train left NYC at 5 p.m. OK, what the fuck. Wouldn\u2019t be the first time I went off script. I hailed a cab and by 4:40, we were punching through Manhattan traffic, me sitting on the edge of my seat, tying my running shoes and thinking of the times growing up when we tied our shoes tight at parties when we thought the cops were for sure going to show up and the running would begin. I figured with the 15-20 minute cab ride to Penn Station and some beastly sprints, and a little luck, I\u2019d be on my way to Beantown and my lovely pre-wife, before the sun started dropping. Plus it\u2019d be nice to greet my tribe first thing Monday morning as the sun came up on more than three hours of sleep. But with a nagging heel injury that kept me from a month of Destination Decks & Summit Ave repeats, gear in both hands, and the clock ticking in my ears like I was wearing headphones, I knew it was a tall order. I didn\u2019t exactly have a game plan. I just knew I\u2019d been preparing for this moment for the past 20 years. \n\nIn speaking to November Project and non-NP folks around the continent, and inside the city I call home, a common answer to the question: \u201cWhat are you training for?\u201d is, simply, \u201cLife.\u201d This always makes me smile. I picture people running from their desks as if aliens are attacking earth or outsprinting hot lava rolling down the street. It makes me think of climbing stairs at the end of a long-ass day and not having the 7th-floor walk-up be the part that tips the scale toward a just-my-shitty-ass-luck feeling, but that instead tightens all the screws. Life. It\u2019s what we make it.\n\nBut mostly, the \u201clife\u201d response takes me back to November, 2003. I was running the stadium alone in the dark with my backpack and headphones. The day of the week didn\u2019t matter back then. I was as fit as I\u2019ve ever been though unaffiliated with any team. Just me and the biggest mistake of my life weighing down on my sweat-covered shoulders like a regretful Silverback Gorilla. I was a 21-year-old smartass who\u2019d just been thrown out of school, along with my scholarship, for letting competitive flare and heated nonsense escalate. Even though the only publication out there that people were reading (and would continue to read before every job interview and first date for the rest of my adult life) was a [ student piece](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2003/4/24/rowers-enter-not-guilty-plea-two/) that never had the follow up truth of the situation, it didn\u2019t seem to matter. This was definitely a Fuck You World tour and I was chewing up sections and spitting them out with a weighted backpack in the dark. I was a silent primal scream in the form of searing lungs and burning muscle, laser focus, and the longest fuckin\u2019 strides I could muster. For those who know the stadium tour well, I was doing a \u201cdouble burger\u201d working from section 37 to section 1 and then back to 37. \n\nI thought I had the place to myself that night, but fifteens minutes in, Harry Parker, the legendary Harvard rowing coach, and his 60 elite Crimson oarsmen suddenly materialized around me like ghosts. Great. I immediately recognized their emblems and the Ivy-League swagger without a second glance. I kept stomping away to the sounds of my Rage Against The Machine playlist. Even in the pitch black they knew who I was. Everyone around the Sprints League loves to say \u201cFUCK HARVARD,\u201d almost as a greeting. I was no different, but as was my brash young style back then, I took it a couple notches further and earned my place as the most hated dude in the Crimson boathouse that year.\n\nI just kept pounding those concrete stairs. This was my house. Coach Parker, all bundled up against the November cold watched his elite boys fly up and down each section (skipping the top and bottom steps for whatever reason \u2013 By doing this you actually skip a total of 74 full seats per tour = over two full sections shy of a legit FULL stadium tour). I blew by the storied coach in the dark. He didn\u2019t see my headphones and said something. I saw his mouth moving with attempted eye contact, but ignored it. I kept on without stopping. Looking back, it was a shitty move. Harry, at that time was well into his sixties and had started winning boat races well before my parents had met. On my way back down that same section, he waved his arms at me. I removed one ear bud. \u201cWhat are you training for?\u201d asked the man who\u2019s had multiple books written about him, with a wry smile possibly hoping I was a giant Harvard student he could pick up and toss into his 4th Varsity lineup further building his army, after all, I was at the Harvard Stadium. I could tell his rowers were curious about the answer, too. So in front of his entire team and straight into the legend\u2019s face, right there in the dark of some New England night, I yelled back after considering the question for less than a fraction of second, \u201cLIFE.\u201d And kept on moving. I thought I was badass and brilliant. Years later, I know I was little of either but I was telling the truth. I was in the middle of the transition that carved me into a better person and a better man. I\u2019ll never know if Harry thought this answer was profound or rude. I\u2019d never get to know him or apologize to him or his team for my actions that set both teams at Harvard and Northeastern back in the Spring of 2003. \n\nFast forward to midtown Manhattan 2014. I\u2019m no longer a competitive rower, but I\u2019m something else, something more. And at the moment, someone trying catch an impossible train. Penn Station is a bunker of architectural nonsense. Well, it is to the late and panicked traveler, at least. Find someone who says its super smooth or that it has a great layout and you\u2019re most likely talking to a conductor or an engineer. Penn Station, though it moves a lot of life and pushes a lot of stories, is NOT inspiring or easy to navigate. I hit the concourse with less than 2 minutes to make the wrong train. \n\nThis is where my training comes in. I\u2019m back at the stadium, back on the hills, back among my tribe, strong, purposeful, I\u2019m better than the 21 year old in the dark and just as fit. Against the knife-like pain in my heel, against the clock, and against the ticket in my hand that reads train #132 instead of train #194, I was dashing toward what I prayed was Track 10E, lashing through the crowd like a maniac. BOOM, I see a sign for it: 10E. And I\u2019m off, voice raised, duffle thrashing through the air like an awkward sidecar with loose wheels. I now have less than 1 minute, 60 single ticks on the clock. I see the empty escalator and can already picture my triumphant race down and onto the train. Someone should be filming this shit. Bojan would make this epic moment even more epic had he been in the rafters with his Nikon cheering me on while capturing a dozen gold frames per second. By the time they look at my ticket, we\u2019ll be in motion leaving the station and it\u2019ll be old news that I\u2019ve jumped the early train. Beautiful. Until I realize the escalator is coming up at me, not going down. I\u2019m running the wrong direction. This isn\u2019t an entrance to 10E. It\u2019s a fuckin exit. FUCK. No time to recalculate. Without changing my pace I race down the wrong-way stairs at top speed, my feet hardly touching.\n\nAt Harvard Stadium, there are probably 10 or 15 NP members who clock sub-25s for all 37 sections. Sometimes, our Wednesday Morning Classic inside the stadium can surge to 600 or more people when you add the 5:30AM and 6:30AM groups together (August 2013 we counted 655 total). Sub 25 is an elite crew of us. Our very first November Project recruit of all time remains our fastest female. Sara Wild, a former soccer stud from Williams College, was the first to join after Bojan and I Tweet\u2019d at @MarathonSports, @NBRunning, and a few others. With a subtle smile and legs of steel, she has been known to take down a \u201cfull tour\u201d in 23 minutes flat. The one thing that\u2019s keeping Wild from catching the small group of dudes who are out in front of her? She doesn\u2019t sprint recklessly DOWN the stone stadium seats (each about the height of 2.5 exit row stairs that the group files down after topping each section). When it comes to pacing and control she\u2019s anything but wild. She leaves the downward slashing-and-dashing to the Gilroy, Morgan Brown, and Deniz types. Sure, I dash down the steps when I can. It makes a giant difference. \u201cGoing down the big ones,\u201d means you are willing to trade rest for speed and that you\u2019re OK with risking finishing with a few less teeth. \n\nAs I\u2019m flying down the 10E exit escalator, I think of Gilroy and Nick Stamas and Sarah Wild and think, \u201cLIFE: here I am. I\u2019ve trained for your ass!\u201d With my eyes focused on the stream of metal steps, I don\u2019t notice the security guard at the bottom staring at me with his jaw dropped. If I\u2019d looked up, I\u2019d have seen him waving his arms to get my attention the way Harry Parker did a decade earlier during my 2 years and 31 days I was in and out of court, working odd jobs and logging 200+ hours of community service around town for my life altering mistake. His hand held up in a halting gesture, the word \u201cSTOP\u201d forming on his lips, I blow by him with maybe 15 seconds until this train\u2014you know, not my train\u2014leaves for Boston. Turning the corner on a dime toward the platform the way we \u201cTURN AND GO\u201d at the stadium, I can now see the entire centipede of cars waiting, humming, clearing its throat to get going. I run alongside hoping to find a door that is open. But they\u2019re sealed tight. The pain in my heel is screaming like a rotten toothache. Banging my hand against the passenger cars, then the dining cars, I\u2019d take help from anyone at this point. And then the shot clock expires. I can almost hear the buzzer. The train begins to move. Like any Amtrak train, the first few inches and feet of movement from the station are so subtle that your eyes can\u2019t even be sure what they were seeing. \u201cIs the train really fucking leaving!?\u201d I say to myself. \n\nNow, we need to be clear about a few things. I miss planes. I miss trains. I get on buses a day early and a day late. I\u2019m not bound to a ticket or an itinerary. I never have been. When I find a new path and have to hustle to make an idea work I do. When I lose a close race, I get over it and adjust. This wasn\u2019t my first missed train. But it wasn\u2019t over yet. Like the scene of Liar Liar at the end when Jim Carey is on the runway with the stairs moving at full speed yelling like a crazy person trying to stop the commercial flight that was moments from taking off, I was in the zone\u2026 like a crazy person. The train was picking up speed. All of a sudden, I hear a voice a few hundred feet away, \u201cIs this your train!?\u201d I see a small circle of a head in the very last car that was closing distance on my pace. \u201cIs this your train!?\u201d I hear. \u201cFuck yeah!!!,\u201d I yell back, without wondering how far he\u2019d look into how wrong my ticket was. \n\nAmtrak staff are a serious and proud bunch. Do not fuck with them. They wear hats and shirts that are molded after the original gear that has been worn for fifty thousand years of on time trains. They shout that trains are leaving and that next stops are NEXT! Even the security guard I blew past at the bottom of the reverse escalator, who only just now do I see is chasing me as I chased the train, has a certain Amtrack dignity. I would loved to have been watching this ridiculous scene unfold. \n\n\u201cIs this your train?! Train 194?! IS. THIS. YOUR. TRAIN?\u201d he demanded a third time the carriages picked up speed and now looked to be leaving me and my \u201cI train for LIFE\u201d ass behind. And how could I lie or possibly tell the truth, we\u2019re at full speed, and I\u2019m about to Indiana Jones the shit out of this train and be off to Boston like the Man! \u201cYes sir, fuck yeah, I mean yes!\u201d I say holding out a ticket with something to show I\u2019d at least given the company money for a trip over the exact section of track on the exact same day. Hoping he\u2019d glance and let me pass, he did the opposite. He squared his shoulders off to block the moving doorway and give him a secure position to study. Shit. I was filled with that busted feeling. Sprinting in jeans, my denim wrapped balls were both guiding me to glory and overheating enough to make me want to stop. The caboose conductor was studying the ticket with calm breath. I was running at top speed with gear and desperation, my weatherproof duffle waving around in one hand like a yellow life raft and my other hand trying to reach out and grab on the grips that would secure my leap into the moving train. His eyes seemingly studying every single printed letter on the ticket as I watched on thinking this show was almost over, \u201cOK, you\u2019re good\u2026\u201d and I began to spring into the\u2026 \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll stop the train.\u201d \n\nMy brain screams: \u201cYou\u2019ll stop the train?! What?! You\u2019ll stop the moving train that is 85% of the way out of Penn Station that\u2019s at sprinting speed? You\u2019ll stop the train for the guy with the bum heel and the lame ticket? You\u2019ll stop the fucking train?\u201d And sure enough, Amtrak train 194 came to a complete stop leaving only one car left overlapping the Penn Station platform. Catching my breath and wiping sweat from my eyes, I stepped on and was greeted by roughly 11 cars of turning heads who wanted to see this exception, this racer, this faker, this\u2026 fucking badass! Yes, I\u2019d raced injured against the clock, through the crowds, from Upper-Upper West Side to Midtown, down the up-escalator, past the defensive line, and into one end zone, only to find myself in another race with an unsympathetic industrial behemoth, then engaging sincerely with a human being who could see I was in need, and I won. I can\u2019t tell you the name of the contest, but that day, I fuckin\u2019 won. As I staggered through the cars, I was vibrating with victory. I sent Goldie a string of texts immediately and none of the words could really explain how I was feeling or the pace that life was racing at that second.\n\nI write this to you from the caf\u00e9 car of that same train that will get me into South Station in downtown Boston at 9-something tonight instead of 1 something, into my woman\u2019s arms, and the next morning into the arms of my tribe. Did this race put a result online that people could LIKE or share? No. Did this race get me ready for my next round of NP workouts? No. But did it prove that I\u2019m able to roll with the punches, work around obstacles, race the clock and beat the odds while winning with people? FUCK YEAH. Am I fit enough to pull odd stunts and be ready for most everything? No question. And I\u2019ll continue to train even harder for even faster trains and even larger security guards and even steeper wrong-way escalators. Bring on the aliens and lava!\n\nThere are no seats on this train because it\u2019s Sunday night. This pre-teen kid, maybe 12, is passed out on our shared table, but I guess he\u2019s got to rest up to tackle the giant boxes of Krispy Kreme\u2019s that are sticking out of his bag. Weird. He\u2019s too young to train for life. He\u2019s not even on the field yet. Oh, I wish I could give him some tips, just like I wish someone could have given the 21-year-old, angry, and misguided version of myself some advice ten years ago. But he\u2019s going to have to learn from his own highest and lowest moments, he\u2019ll have to create his own training plan. Because LIFE, as I\u2019m reminded again and again, is always ready to thrown down. Always. So all you can do is train harder. \n\n_If Malcolm Howard is reading this, know that I will carry my history for life and continue to fuel the good in this world like a speeding train. Like I said to you at Northeastern University the last time we met, I\u2019m truly sorry. _\n", "title": "Hailing Amtrack Trains", "url": "http://november-project.com/hailing-amtrack-trains-for-life/", "workout_entry": true, "author": "brogan", "location": "POINT (-71.0635000000000048 42.3581000000000003)", "date": "2014-04-03", "dow": 3}, "model": "novproj.post", "pk": 15}, {"fields": {"body": "Usually our Firedrill workouts involve cowbells.

I think that my love for the first day of the work week developed in 4th grade when I got introduced to basketball. Our practices were on Monday, Wednesday and Friday (schedule sounds familiar?) but every Monday we got to play free-for-all full-court game instead of doing bunch of drills and plays that were on the schedule for the remainder of the week. Now keep in mind that the 4th grade basketball game book looks pretty thin. Our coach somehow always ran the same play, pass it to that annoying kid that was 10 time better than anyone else and get out of his way. On game day our team\u2019s best player was the only to score, and rest of us were competing on who\u2019s going to have the most assist, rebounds, blocks, steals\u2026 Since my position was always under the basket the only place where I could excel during the game day was rebounding. But not on Monday. On Monday I got to do whatever I want, including chucking the ball from the half court, trying to score by bouncing the ball of the gym walls, and attempting the nasty [Michel Jordan crossover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S6mh7RYcqc) that somehow always ended with the ball smacking my crotch. But I loved it! \n\nFast forward twenty years and I\u2019m half way around the world in the country called The United States of America. Instead of hurting my nut-sack with basketballs I\u2019m meeting an amazing group of people all over the city that I now call home. Instead of shooting half-court buzzer beaters 2 minutes into the game I\u2019m exploring locations that I never thought could be utilized for sharing seven minutes of burpees. And I\u2019m having as much fun as I did when I was 10 years old.

It rolled in, froze out bones but most importantly prevented us from tagging gear. As you know last Wednesday of the month is the PR day. This is the day when all our training throughout the month, is put to test in one giant effort to run the full tour of Harvard stadium as fast as we can. This is also the day when our paint squad a.k.a. the Paint Shop Boys tags hundreds of t-shirts with recognizable November Project logo across the chest. This morning, unfortunately, the 30mph winds gusting at 50mph prevented aerosol black paint compressed in the aluminum can to come out in any sort of predictable pattern. So instead of ruining bunch of shirts we decided to move the painting to some other day. Stay tuned for the new paint date announcement. \n\nIt was good to see the Harvard football team back on the field. This means that spring training is in full swing and that warmer days are ahead of us\u2026 in June or July. \n\n**MILWAUKEE NOTES**: \n\nNovember Project Milwaukee had it\u2019s second PR Workout today and it was cold \u2013 again. That\u2019s better. We run cold. We are cold-blooded. Sophia House proved to be uncatchable (Even by Kellen) and some HUMUNGOUS TIME DROPS HAPPENED. Notably: Maggie Nelson, 4 minute drop in a 30ish minute workout. To put that in perspective that\u2019s like if last week you fought, and defeated 30 ninjas, this week you could have taken on 34, and defeated them all!!! Come to Novmeber Project \u2013 you never know how many ninjas are at your door. The Tribe isn\u2019t going anywhere, get on board. The Animal. That got out of the cage\u2026 (Scores to be posted this evening on [November Project Milwaukee Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/npmke).\n\n**SACRAMENTO NOTES**: \n\nToday\u2019s workout got us dirty and a little wet. With the Spring rain fall coming down on us this morning, the regulars found a way to stay indoors, while the smallest group we have ever seen came out and busted their asses in our Wednesday NP workout. Co-Leader roll call, Chris and Haley were there this morning, but co-leader Stephanie woke up puking, though we have no photo evidence to prove it. Whatever she got from her late night out drinking was clearly contagious as we were missing one of our other regulars to group, Juan. \n\nAnyways with the small group of four that did the workout, we started off with a 1 mile warm-up then it was on like Donkey Kong! Haley mustered up a nice routine today that mixed in sprints, burpees, squat jumps, peak planks, and sumo squat jumps. The routine would have us sprinting for 17 seconds then going through one of the exercises for 30 seconds and continuing to repeat this cycle of insanity until Haley decided we were done.\n\nWe have nearly 140 \u201clikes\u201d on our [Facebook](http://facebook.com/NovProjectSMF) page, which we started a few weeks back, with most of of those people from the Sacramento area \u2026 so here is our question \u2026 When the fuck are you people going to get off of Facebook and actually start working out with us instead of just liking our post and photos after our workouts? \n\n**MINNEAPOLIS NOTES**:\n\nToday we began the beautiful but chilly March morning with a lap around the mall and a hearty game of leap frog. Big shout out our several newcomers! After the warm-up we transitioned into the main workout which consisted of suicide runs up several sets up stairs and down the mall on the University campus. The destinations for the suicides were classroom buildings that line the sides of the mall. A set of pushups, squat jumps, hot-footed lizards, and jumping jacks were incorporated into the suicides. The final portion of the workout had groups of three run in between a set of buildings while one person at one side was doing push ups and the other and the other side was holding a plank position. The person running in between was to tag off one person at one side of the building and that person got up and became the runner that headed to the other to tag off the next person. We ended with a beautiful photo taken as the sun rose.  great job today MSP!\n\n**NYC NOTES**:\n\nWe were expecting some snow today which would\u2019ve been appropriate since we had snow each of the first 5 pledge workouts. No snow, but we still had over 40 hardcore tribers (10+ newbies) ready to crush today\u2019s session. In honor of almost finishing our first trimester worth of workouts (yes, we\u2019ve been around for 10 weeks), threw the workout waaaay back to the OG location at the 103rd St. footbridge. We replicated our first November Project-NYC workout by doing repeat bridge climbs with work stations in between. Work stations consisted of: 10 push ups, 30 secs of plank, 10 burpees, and 30 secs of dancing. Dancing style or moves were at the discretion of each tribe member. Fuck Yeah, we KNOW we can dance! \n\nMembers of the loyal tribe made good on their promise to bring gear to be grass-rooted. Paulleak and Patrick stenciled like crazy while everyone else got their sweat on. \n\nOther highlights:\n\n-Jason getting in extra speedwork by chasing down two traveling dwellers of Randall\u2019s Island who had \u201caccidentally\u201d picked up his backpack. \n\n-A cyclist finding a phone, giving it to co-leader John, and a happy reunion of phone and owner later that morning. I think we just recruited another member. We got a verbal! \n\nSee you next Wednesday, 6:28 a.m. at the flagpole by Gracie Mansion. Bring a friend.\n\n**LA NOTES**:\n\nLA was on point this morning! The tribe is pointy?\u2026 We welcomed the dark with several newbies and some Madison and Boston regulars who did not know what they were getting into with our Hollywood ways. Warmed up. Hug. Circle bounce. Jog.\n\nSince today was PR day, aka the day for your personal achievements and goals, we started our own little race that incorporates strength and speed called the J-Baby. Some say it is named after the shape of the course others say it will give you a booty like J-Lo. Nobody knows. Even though the Hollywood Bowl is made of stairs and the tears of hollywood wannabes, we used neither in our workout. Well maybe the tears. Starting with \u201cthe bitch\u201d, a steep hill that runs along the bowl, the tribe beasted up to the top whipping out jump squats, to then continue on the outskirts to do burpees, to make a descent to toe touches and box jumps all to be repeated three times. Though the tribe is still waiting on their grassroots gear they represented complete community today. We made new friends, cheered them on, and got our sweaty hugs. People pushed each other along and splashed in the puddles that LA so rarely has. As always we can not wait till Wednesday. Yes! The Tribe is pointy!\n", "title": "Last Group Post of #Turbo15", "url": "http://november-project.com/last-group-post-of-turbo15/", "workout_entry": true, "author": "bojan", "location": "POINT (-71.0635000000000048 42.3581000000000003)", "date": "2014-03-26", "dow": 2}, "model": "novproj.post", "pk": 19}, {"fields": {"body": "As most of you know, our Monday meetups are only 1/3 of the workout that we get to do together.

The workout that I named **13 Minutes in Heaven** literally 15 seconds ago, has nothing to do with middle school, making out (at least not during the workout), or hiding in a closet, but it is done with a partner and the time on the clock is moved from 7 to 13 minutes. This is also an ultimate \u201cI got your back\u201d workout as the effort of your partner dictates how long your suffering period is. \n\nWhile one person is doing an approximate 100 yard dash the other one needs to do 5 burpees and then hold the plank until the partner returns. Only a physical tag releases the partner from the plank. We completely ignored that whole I-saw-you-30-yards-away-and-I-was-getting-ready-to-start-running-so-I-stopped-doing-the-plank bullshit and only allowed the touch as an official sign to move from planking to sprinting.

It\u2019s been a while since we ran the full length of the section (31 steps) and I definitely felt every single one of them. The bubble is down, which means the spring is not too far behind, but let\u2019t not get too cocky about it, we might jinx it. Happy Wednesday! \n\n**MILWAUKEE NOTES**: \n\nNovember Project welcomed the rain this morning because it was accompanied by 40 degrees of Fahrenheit.  \nWe had 6 Newbs and countless stairs (80 stairs).  \nWe had two generations of Massie and we spray painted an ass.  \nYou can bear crawl down 80 wet stairs, we did.  \nBell laps marked our intervals and Monsta Jamz set the pace.  \nWe love each other, and each moment.\n\nFriends brought. The tribe is NOT lonely. MKE OUT.\n\n**SACRAMENTO NOTES**:\n\nWe got out to McKinley Park in Sacramento this morning and saw some familiar faces of the tribe, as well as welcomed a couple new faces. Co-leaders Haley and Chris arrived early to welcome the group, while Co-Leader Stephanie came sprinting in just before 6:31AM. Apparently there are various time zones in Sacramento. \n\nAfter we gave our high-fives, handshakes and hugs at the start of the workout, Haley instructed the group of today\u2019s workout. Today\u2019s workout involved a 2 mile warm-up run, then proceeded into some partner workouts. While one partner was popping a (wall) squat against a tree the other was doing bear crawls, lunges and crab walks. Don\u2019t worry no actual animals were used in today\u2019s workouts, however those that did do the workouts were beast! After the partner exercises the group finished with a 1 mile run.\n\nThe tribe is slowly growing, though we might not be as big as some of the other tribes around, we can still kick the shit out of a workout with the best of them. \n\nNot in photo: Derrick, Rich, Rachelle, Ken (all had to leave by 7:00AM due to work) and Co-Leader Chris (took photo)\n\n**LA NOTES**:\n\nOnce again the tribe awoke to the unique city we call \u201cthe City of Angeles\u201d. Newbies, Germans, new friends and old friends gathered outside the bowl. We circle bounced our way to a bit of perspiration and discovered that our favorite underground tunnel was locked but that did not stop us from going apeshit for the rest of the workout. Today we did a little work out that we like to call the \u201cBurpee Pyramid\u201d. The Burpee Pyramid consist of a 5,10,15,10,5 Burpee configuration with stair sections in between for 35 minutes. Walk(scratch that) RUN like an Egyptian. People pushed each other up the steps and motivated even the most elite of the burpee masters. Completed, we ran a mad dash to the top of the bowl. The tribe is Fresh!\n\n**NEW YORK NOTES**:\n\nWe started off the morning welcoming 45 hardcore souls (20 newbies) which is our all-time high\u2013the tribe is growing stronger, soon to be Super Shredder strong. In the spirit of March Madness our family showed up sporting their favorite college/team gear. Our tribe was rocking Boston College, Boston University, Middlebury, St. John\u2019s, Team Red, White, & Blue, Texas A&M, Colgate, UNC, Villanova, Virginia Tech, and more. \n\nWorkout comprised of two 15-minute sessions around Charles Schurz Park. The first 15 mins of a figure-eight course with alternating dips and step-up stations at the intersection was where we rocked the NP DC Spotify playlist (still listening to it now). Took a 1-2 minute rest, basically just all listened to Naughty By Nature. Then back on the grind with 15 mins of the figure-eight course (in reverse) with alternating push ups and dancing stations at the intersection. One of our newbies taught us all how to dougie.\n\nOur group shot was March Madness-themed. But you know this, BALLIN.\n\nMINNEAPOLIS NOTES:\n\nToday we began the morning with our typical warm up around the mall area at the U of M. The first lap was an easy jog and the second lap brought back the less offensive \u201cYeti\u201d runs that us Minnesotans take pride in. We then went back by the river to the \u201chalf-pipe\u201d and ran a slow-burn workout up and down one side of the \u201chalf-pipe\u201d hill. At the end of each up and down we did a set of jumping jacks followed by a set of squat jumps followed by another set of jumping jacks. I think all members of this morning\u2019s crew were able to get 4 reps in.

We met at our normal 6:30AM time in front of the McKinley Park Library sign. As members of our local tribe arrived just before the start of the workout, we said our hellos, shared some laughs, and even mocked Co-Leader Stephanie for her being, as usual, almost on time arrival.

We are out there\u2026 no matter what it takes. \n\nThis morning\u2019s workout hugged the eastern banks of the Mississippi River. Hills, planks, stair stepping, and high fives were the meat & potatoes. The rest was a blur of hugs, smiles, sweat, and prospects of a day ahead in which we all get to be proud of ourselves. Debuts were made this morning by Andy \u201cManifest\u201d Corkery & Kara Belair. We are all pumped to have their power around for the weeks to come.\n\nBe apart of this group. It\u2019s like going to the gym, only it\u2019s free, outside\u2026 and way different.\n\n**LOS ANGELES NOTES**:\n\nOn this Episode of November Project Los Angeles. Newbies crawled out of their bed to see what the commotion was about at the Hollywood hills. A new co-leader was introduced, Angelo Neroni, a man of many talents. It would only make sense that with his swift Italian movements, heart of pure oro, and the absolute drive to encourage and spread November Project across this city would make him the perfect co-leader. So per Angelo\u2019s request the tribe warmed up with a synchronized circle bounce brushing soon to be sweaty bodies against each. The crazy dog lady, Abbie, brought her pooch, Boots, who got a little close and personal during our little jump session. After a very technical warm up we started with a little workout by the \u201cnombre\u201d \u201cCouples Retreat\u201d. Couples Retreat is not a Vince Vaughn rom-com, but a 35 minute partnered exercised geared towards you and a stranger getting to know someone with stairs, burpees, squats, v-ups, and jumping jacks. Think of it as tag team wrestling, one person runs stairs while the other is doing the appropriate exercise. High fives, smiles and hugs were exchanged. And although people were a little thrown off at the darkness of day light savings they still tackled the bowl. \u201cFuck yeahs\u201d were cheered in the bowl getting some peculiar looks. We had several newbies arrive who we welcomed with open arms and huge smiles. We love you crazy hooligans.

There are some people you run into in life that you know have the stuff. When I first met Shanae and waved hello in passing on [Summit Ave](http://november-project.com/summit-ave/) I realized that her nickname must become \u201cElectric Smile.\u201d Knowing little about her, what I did know is that she had the stuff. As an active student at Emerson College she comes to us in the mornings with very little sleep under her belt but never without her electric smile.

Take your time as you read this post and please share it to the ones you love as inspiration for how to **JUST SHOW UP**. Ladies and gentlemen\u2026 Shanae Rebecca! **\r\n\r\nIf anyone would have told me that I would be training for the 2014 Boston Marathon with November Project six months after running my first _EVER_ half marathon, I don\u2019t think I would have believed them. Athletes run the Boston Marathon \u2013 and not just athletes \u2013 elite ones! \u201cOne day,\u201d I would have said, \u201cbut this isn\u2019t my year.\u201d I would have rattled off that my dream would be to make Chicago my first marathon (fast and flat), and after YEARS of racing \u2013 I would attempt to qualify for Boston\u2026 I would have used very apologetic language (A bad habit I\u2019m still trying to break) and it would have been totally non-committal. \r\n\r\nOn December 16th though I received the following text message from my friend Monica who was deeply affected by the events that transpired last April\u2026\r\n\r\nI was sitting at the [Thinking Cup](http://www.thinkingcup.com/) when I received that text. I was astounded! \u201cWOWZA! 26.2 miles! That would be amazing! Maybe I shouldn\u2019t though\u2026 It might re-trigger emotions I ..what about \u2018running in\u2019 Lauren \u2013 wait, this is moving too fast!\u201d As I looked down to text my initial hesitations, the charm from my recent Alex and Ani purchase reminded me \u201cWhat\u2019s For You Will Not Pass You.\u201d Up until that point, I had been attending the workouts regularly and had accomplished some pretty cool NP, but also professional and personal, milestones. I just couldn\u2019t let the opportunity to run on her behalf pass me \u2013 I had to practice what we preach at NP and **JUST SHOW UP**! \r\n\r\nIt was in fact showing up that led to\u2026  \r\n*completing my first tour around Harvard Stadium and weeks later a FrogMan1! *shedding 25lbs and 6 minutes off my time to PR the Hyannis Half with a 2:02 finish!\r\n\r\nBUT ALSO\r\n\r\n*Meeting some of the greatest people on the planet! (Hi, FRIENDS!)  \r\n*Learning how to give a REAL HUG (Hips in, yall.)\r\n\r\nSHOWING UP with all of my fears and doubts, but also my smile, hugs, and determination would be the continued goal. There was nothing to worry about! I would have NP and NP would have me through the good and the bad\u2013 and not just MWF! A long run on the course any Saturday or Sunday morning means seeing familiar faces and sharing enthusiastic embraces! Training with NP means you\u2019ll have someone to sit with at the Marathon Clinic, but also someone to celebrate with or even salsa dance with on Friday. The tribe is a family! \r\n\r\nI\u2019ll never forget when NP became one of the most important parts of my life:\r\n\r\nWhen Orrin Whalen (newest leader of NP LA) first invited me to an NP Workout last April, I kindly thanked him for thinking of me, but said \u201cNo Way!\u201d I finally dropped a verbal and met Orrin for Destination Deck: Tennis Courts on the eve of my 22nd birthday. I had been training for my first half marathon with a few ladies from Black Girls Run \u2013 a grassroots organization working to get more African American women moving and grooving in the fitness community, but I was avoiding the inclines. Orrin thought my training could get kicked up a notch, and surely it has! \r\n\r\nTo think that one of my final hours as a \u201cwild\u201d 21 year old was the first spent with NP makes me chuckle. I figure SHOWING UP is just the beginning of adulthood. That\u2019s why accountability, attitude, awesome, and attendance all start with an A, right?\r\n\r\nJust under 40 days away from April 21st, I owe many thanks to the Boston Tribe for keeping me honest during my training and pushing me closer and closer to the goal. The _Right on Hereford, and Left on Boylston_ will be special this year for more reasons than one, but my excitement for the Mile 18 NP Hydration Station and Cheer Squad will be unmatched. \r\n\r\nTraining for Boston with NP has reignited my love for this city in a way my heart didn\u2019t know to wish for. NP provided me with the tools to train, but also a place to build my confidence for mental prep. This IS my year to run 26.2 miles and cross the finish line.

We had a PR for attendance which included 5 newbies (one was Emily who we pulled from her regular morning jaunt) + a reporter and a camera guy from a NYC newspaper. \n\nWe met at our usual spot, [Gracie Mansion](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gracie+Mansion+Conservancy/@40.7761101,-73.9432478,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xe0d98de15d0f86a8) (Mayor DiBlasio\u2019s pad), did our tribal chants and welcome, before trotting over to Charles Shultz Park (30 sec jog). We broke the tribe into two groups and then pairs. Our coupled brethren alternated between doing stair/grotto loops and core (push-ups, planks, burps, dips, and dancing). Two sets of that while blasting the soundtrack from our _1984 Pump Up Mixx_ was just the wake-up call we needed this morning. Our workout concluded with a relay race, a group hug, and singing Happy Birthday to our badass bearded co-leader Paul. \n\nOther highlights included a few waves from NYPD police officers who were on patrol in their light-flashing patrol van, startling a few local neighbors walking their dogs, and a few hugs from two older women who were power-walking along the promenade\u2026 and that was all before we even got going.\n\nWe\u2019re excited to join the other tribes as we start the already legendary #Turbo15 \u2013 Please send your NYC friends and family our way. The tribe is strong. \n\n**MILWAUKEE NOTES** by Dan Graham AKA \u201cDeege\u201d\n\nMilwaukee might never thaw out after this winter but the tribe from 2014 has proven to be #weatherproof beyond expectation. Friends have brought friends. Daughters have brought dads. And self-described \u201clazy basterds\u201d have proven themselves strong. Can\u2019t for for every Wednesday for the rest of time. The tribe is here. \n\n**MINNEAPOLIS NOTES** by Ben Bauch: \n\n19 Minnesotan met today\u2019s still-starry morning to endure the seemingly endless winter elements. Each one of us had the right to remain under our blankets, hit the snooze, and wait for the sun to tell us to get out of bed. But this tribe is stronger than that. Instead we drove, jogged, and biked through the snow, slush, and darkness to call in the morning with an unknown workout. We only knew that it would be difficult. Mentally, we were already stronger upon showing up.\n\n12 total loops around \u201cThe Ring,\u201d mingled with \u2018hoisties,\u2019 \u2018flying dutchmen,\u2019 and burpees made for a loud and sweaty morning. Jeff Sereno, Brothers Broshat, and BCoop rose to the responsibility of ending our workout through their own individual efforts. They were heroes today. \n\nWe will all proceed today in classrooms, cubicles, and skyscrapers feeling fulfilled that we started our days at a high velocity. We are the November Project MSP tribe and we\u2019ll be back in one week. \n\n**LOS ANGELES NOTES** by Orrin Whalen:\n\nThe sun sprinkled over Tinsel Town and people a like were waking up running across the Hollywood walk of fame, trekking from the dreaded valley or even dropping your husband off at work. The Jurassic Park looking mist made the sky glow bright as the crazies gathered on the outside of the bowl.\n\nTo celebrate Mardi Grad, a day late, beads were passed out to those who showed positivity and sheer badassy-ness. With a little warm up we ran to Hollywood Blvd and screamed and cheered in the tunnel underpass. The tribe is excited. We really hit the pavement partnering up with wheel barrow races and piggy back rides like true John Wayne look a likes. The tribe is silly.\n\nGetting to the bulk of our work out we partnered up doing five exercise. In between each exercise we added an additional set of stairs. [Hoisties](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nmyd38eIPs) (a NP Wisconsin creation) were introduced, high five push ups exchanged, burpees thrown down, v-up freeze holds held, and supermans annihilated. The tribe is solid.\n\n_In recap of the randomness_:  \nA construction worker kindly rejected beads almost as if it was a kiss.  \nOur fastest partners, Angelo and Vance, were rewarded with the famous \u201cGo Girl\u201d soda (Not only are they fast dudes but also motivators)  \nBetty, the wife of the grounds keeper of the Bowl, joined us for the workout to see what the madness was all about. A positive spirit that represents the tribe.\n\nHere\u2019s to those that have made the tribe strong thus far and here\u2019s to all those that will join us in the future. You are all welcome here. The tribe has spoken. \n\n**SACRAMENTO NOTES** by Sacramento:\n\nThe lines of communication are running slow in this part of California. Sorry about this kind of showing on our day one.

That night the greater Boston area braced for the imminent onslaught of the polar vortex that was angrily charging towards the city like the Broncos defensive line towards Tom Brady.\n\n\u201cJust show up\u201d tweeted the November Project.\n\nThe following morning in the darkness just before sunrise, a boisterous, and occasionally foul-mouthed group of neon clad workout warriors, some looking like physically fit and fluorescent Michelin men, walked, jogged, biked or skied in frigid temperatures to the top of Summit Ave in Brookline. Their normal workout routine was only mildly interrupted by an abundance of ice, snow and cold. While the rest of the city was comfortably tucked into their warm little beds, this crew traded their bunny slippers for sneakers and snow shovels and proceeded to dig out the neighborhood like penguins with a purpose. It was an inspirational example of community love if ever there was one.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what I heard. While they were out there, I was snuggled up in bed doing my best impression of Goldilocks on Nyquil. Later that day, I was struck by feelings of amazement, bewilderment and envy after reading what happened.\n\n\u201cNo way!\u201d  \n\u201cHow could this be?\u201d  \n\u201cDidn\u2019t they listen to the nice weather guy?\u201d  \n\u201cMan, I wish I had just shown up.\u201d\n\nThings changed after that. If I was coherent enough at 5 AM to put one foot in front of the other (and not impaired by geography or family commitments) I resolved to get my ass to the workout regardless of whatever Mother Nature threw at me. Shit might happen to make things difficult, but there was no way I was going to miss out again.\n\nAs I write this, I am sitting in the waiting room at Brigham & Womans hospital. My wife is in surgery. She was recently diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 38. Fortunately, chances of a full recovery are good. She will be okay, but the process will be long and mentally exhausting for our family. It seems crazy to be thinking about a loony band of runners who meet three times a week to jump up and down and hug one another while she is under the knife, but sometimes you think about weird stuff in times of stress. \n\nOr maybe it\u2019s not so weird. To an outsider, the November Project may seem like a smiley jumble of goofball twenty-somethings who are into stair climbing and selfies. However, those of you who\u2019ve hoisted your share of Hoistiees know better. The November Project isn\u2019t just about Burpees, Bojans, F-Bombs and Grassroots Gear. These things are truly badass and completely worth the price of admission, but they\u2019re not even close to the whole story. At its core \u2026 its essence \u2026 its mother-fucking soul, the November Project is about accomplishing shit you never thought you could, and overcoming obstacles you never thought you\u2019d encounter. It\u2019s about triumph over self-doubt, and the irrepressible desire to take on challenges most people try to avoid. If you\u2019ve completed \u201cFrogman 1,\u201d you understand this.\n\nNobody wants to find out that their wife has cancer, or they\u2019ve been let go from their job, or their favorite TV show has been cancelled, or that Kanye and Kim are having relationship problems. However, just like the polar vortex, the unexplainable often occurs. It\u2019s easy to bitch, moan, make excuses and feel sorry for yourself. It\u2019s better to take whatever hand grenade life throws at you and throw it right back. Bruce Springsteen said it best, \u201cSome guys they just give up living, start dying little by little piece by piece. Some guys come home from work and wash up, and go racing in the streets.\u201d No matter what happens in life, you have two choices, give up or jump up and get back into the race.\n\nOur family may have some challenges ahead of us, but thankfully I\u2019ve learned a few things while scaling my share of icy ninja stairs. If you just show up, give out a few hugs, run fast and maybe drop a few strategically placed F bombs, there will be a happy photograph in your future. For me, this is the lesson of the November Project, and I\u2019m grateful to have had the opportunity to learn it.\n\nFuck Yeah. \n", "title": "A Happy Photograph Is In Your Future!

Nothing major. \n\nBut I started going, and going, and going, weaving in and out of people on busy streets like the fucking Energizer Bunny. Then it was over, and my GPS on my phone told me I ran 13.04 miles. \n\n**What the fuck**? When did I get to the point where a normal run consisted of picking up and running a half marathon? \n\nThis is where all you crazy fuckers come in. \n\nI started working out with NP (Boston) last July, confused as all hell as to why people were whispering and body surfing humans like Bono was playing at the Garden at the top of Summit Ave. My beginnings were rough.

This whole \u201cfree fitness\u201d thing is not gonna get the best of me. It\u2019s not gonna discourage me. And now eight months later I\u2019m just picking up and running a casual half marathon. \n\nThat\u2019s the point. I hear it all the time from people that they don\u2019t want to try NP because they are slow, or they don\u2019t feel comfortable, or there is no way they would be able to keep up. \n\nHogwash. That\u2019s bullshit. \n\nSure you might not turn into one of the lead dogs out there, but you\u2019ll get better. That 5-mile run you swore you couldn\u2019t do. You will. Those sections you thought you\u2019d never conquer. It will happen. Those people you thought were strangers. They will become friends. \n\nSo the next time I black out from miles 8 to 13, maybe I\u2019ll see one of you crazy people pounding the pavement with that same \u201cHow did I get here?\u201d look.

Yet, on this brisk February morning, the Tribe executed a fast paced Olympic themed workout to near perfection.

In fact, the tribe showed up in full Olympic colors, raced for their respective teams and then managed to cross over team lines and embrace their morning rivals for our Newbie Medal ceremony (ceremony may be a bit of an overstatement).\n\nOur boy Steve declared himself as a winner this morning by showing up in full Polish Olympic garb. You just can\u2019t find good Polish Olympic gear these days so Steve went out and made some of his own.

Kaci Wright and Car Dom Sob also braved the elements for their first workout.

When we showed up to what appeared to be a snow covered field, which in actuality was just 2 inches of slushy water covered with a layer of untouched snow melting in unseasonable 50 degree conditions resulting in thick fog, the rain immediately start pouring all over our confused bodies that just 48 hours before were trying to stay warm in minus penguin conditions. To maintain the confusion we decided to wake up everyone living within 2 block radius from Clemente field by making very [loud noises](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UplJBQi_0_w), runing multiple 60 yard dashes through the slosh that kept our bodies warm \u2013 our lungs burning \u2013 our hearts beating fast \u2013 and our feet numb from the freezing water. **PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT**: It\u2019s probably a good idea to invest in a merino wool socks for these types of conditions. To make things fun and interesting, we threw in few somersaults and parter sprints and went home still confused about what just happened.

But looking back we\u2019d do it all over again the exactly the same way. So to repay Summit Ave folks for their support and kindness we tossed around ideas like community cookie packages left on doorsteps, a get-to-know-NP cookout, or weekend block parties\u2026 But there was one idea that always stood out as an amazing and totally impossible stunt, with countless variables that would have to land just right in order for it to be successful, and this friends was the Shovel Shuffle. For \u201cShoffle\u201d (see what I did there?) to go down we had to have few elements line up for us: \n\n**1\\. Fresh snow**. The chances of having literally tons of snow falling down the night before a Friday morning workout and no one clearing it before we get there are always pretty slim. Brookline residents to a pretty darn good job of taking care of THEIR driveway and sidewalk stretches.  \n**2\\. Enough large snow shovels**. We assumed that most of us live in apartment buildings that have management companies to take care of snow removal issues. Consequentially this would completely remove the need of owning a shovel to clear the sidewalk. Apparently we were wrong. Our shovel per member ratio was approximately 1:2 which made for a great shovel-run-shovel workout.\n\n**3\\. Cult-like member following** willing enough to walk/run/ski/snowshoe for miles to clear strangers sidewalks and driveways and actually shovel enough of the snow for people to take notice. This one I\u2019m proud of the entire Brookline side of the Summit Ave hill was snow free on both sidewalks after we were done with it! Well done boys and girls, this speaks volumes about your character and badassness!\n\nSo when I got a note from our in-house mathematician Ari saying that we may have perfect Shoffle conditions courtesy of Winter Storm Hercules, I pulled this move:\n\nI want to apologize to our neighbors that live on the Brighton side of the hill as we didn\u2019t have enough time to get to your sidewalks.

On chilly December day, when asked what\u2019s the distance of #[Frogman1](http://november-project.com/frogman1/), he whipped out his calculator, wikipedia, and MS Word, and went to work. Now he claims that if you were to do stadium 17 weeks in the row, it will equal summiting Mt. Everest. Is this statement true, we have no clue, but his arguments are very compelling. Ladies and gentleman, we present Ari Ofsevit.  \n_\n\nIt all started with the following facebook exchange:\n\nTo answer his question, and because I am a #HUGEnerd, I posted the following (with some edits):\n\nOkay \u2026 so the math gets tricker (funner) here:\n\nFirst, we have to calculate the distance around the stadium. Can we use a Garmin-type device? No, for two reasons. One, it\u2019s just not accurate enough to figure out how far the small and repeated segments are. Two is that GPS works by looking for satellites, which are generally in the southern sky. When you\u2019re running the stadium, especially on the south side, you can \u201csee\u201d ~0 satellites, so data gets crap. \n\nTo start, let\u2019s assume that you come down the steps, you #turnandgo halfway along the bottom section, run straight to the top, and then run to the next flight of stairs. We could do this with math with circles, or with Google Maps. Let\u2019s do the latter. If you were to run around the bottom step, it would be about 0.2 miles around the stadium, but if you were to run around the top, 0.25 (with the whole circle circumference thing, we could calculate this all with pi but we\u2019d still be guesstimating the width of the stadium between the walls*). Let\u2019s split the difference and call this 0.225 miles. However, for reasons that will be apparent in a moment, we\u2019ll use feet. It\u2019s 1188 feet. We\u2019ll call this a (the distance around the bottom step of the stadium) plus b (the distance around the top step) divided by two. Or, a+b/2. Or divided by 74 to get the distance across one section, about 32 feet.\n\nBut then you\u2019re going up and down the stairs, right? Here\u2019s where the feet come in. I haven\u2019t used a tape measure, but I have used the knowledge that my hands are 9 inches from thumb to pinky (this is a good thing for anyone to know!) to deduce that the steps are 18 inches high each. And the same measurements to figure out that they are 30 inches deep. I\u2019m pretty sure these are the exact measurements. Why? Because when the stadium was built in 1903, they weren\u2019t using the metric system, and I sincerely doubt any good engineer would design a step to be 17 5/8 inches high and 29 13/6 inches deep. 18 and 30 are round numbers (1\u00bd and 2\u00bd feet for our metrically-challenged/Serbian friends). With 31 steps, you ascend 46.5 feet and cover 77.5 feet each time you climb and descend a section.\n\nAh! But what about the elevation? In a 37 section stadium, you climb 1720.5 feet. (524m; 37 sections, 31 steps, 18 inches per step. Do the math, mfers.) Actually a couple less with the metal floor over in 1-3, but I\u2019m ignoring that for now since you have to climb a couple extra steps to get to the concourse at the end of 1. If you want the true distance covered, you have to look in to the hypotenuse of the triangle formed by the 77.5 feet across and the elevation differential (46.5 feet). Another way to put this is the distance across, which we\u2019ll call c, and 0.6c. \n\nRemember trigonometry? It turns out that when you\u2019re climbing at a 60% (30\u00ba) grade, there\u2019s enough differential to be quite significant.** The Pythagorean theorem posits that a squared plus b squared equals c squared. Since, in this case, c = 1, all we need is to square 0.6 (it\u2019s 0.36) add 1 to that, and take the square root of 1.36 (1.166) and multiply that by 77.5. Put the numbers in, and the distance covered actually climbs from 77.5 feet to 90.38 feet. Multiply that by 74 and convert it to miles and you get 1.27 miles ([you can Google this](https://www.google.com/search?q=\\(sqrt\\(1.36\\)*77.5*74\\)+feet+in+miles)).\n\nBut! This is assuming you run in Pacman-style right angles. Wouldn\u2019t you save a lot by running diagonally up each section? Maybe a whole lot? Well, you\u2019ll save some, but not really that much. First of all, you\u2019re still going straight down the little steps, so that doesn\u2019t save anything. If we really want to, we can figure out how much you could save if you ran a full diagonal up each section. Do we really want to? Is the Pope Catholic? Back to Pythagoras! This time the sides of the right angle are the distance we calculated earlier (90.38 feet) and the distance around the stadium divided by 37 (32 feet). This is conveniently 95.88 feet. Why? Because 90.38+32-95.88 = 26.5, the number of feet you save by running the diagonal for each section. This is shown as d. Over 37 sections you\u2019d save 0.186 miles if you did this for the whole stadium. But who does that? If you\u2019re doing a proper #turnandgo you pretty much run like Pacman anyway. (For this little bit of math, I ignored the diagonals of the curved sections, which would be ever-so-slightly different.)\n\nSo, where were we? A the up-and-down part of the stadium is 1.27 miles. Add in the lateral distance across the stairs to get 1.5. But then you have to walk back to the start, and you do this around the top, so that\u2019s another 0.25 miles. Total? 1.75. What about a #frogman1? Well, since you\u2019re only repeating the uncurved sections (you do two extra segments which are slightly, but negligibly, curved) you can add 0.16 across the sections, and 0.45 miles up and down the stairs; or a total of about 0.61 miles. So a #frogman1 is 2.11. If you go 37-1-13, you\u2019re part way back to the start, and you only have 0.16 miles to get back to 37, so that\u2019s 2.27 miles total. If you go 37-1-13-1, add another 0.16 miles, and it\u2019s 2.43 miles. \n\nSo a #frogman1 is at least 2 miles. Now, what if you run diagonally up the stairs? Even if you\u2019re running the diagonals, you\u2019re still going to make at least 2 full miles in a #frogman1. And you\u2019re going to climb about half a mile. That\u2019s what you\u2019re feeling the next day.\n\n(Or I could be wrong. I retired from math a long time ago.)\n\n* It should be noted that Harvard Stadium might well be responsible for the forward pass in football. The game turned quite violent in the early 1900s and several rule changes were discussed to make the game safer. One was to spread out play by widening the field by 40 feet to 200 feet. Harvard objected, since they\u2019d just built a stadium (the largest concrete structure in the world at the time) for a 160-foot-wide field. So, instead, the rules committee introduced the forward pass. Also, the stadium once was a full circle with metal bleachers connecting the river side. If those were still around we\u2019d probably run in circles forever. There was, at one point, a second set of entrances two thirds of the way up (which explains the blocked-off middle-level concourse).

I have to admit, we were (not on purpose) favoring Downtown/Brookline/Cambridge residents with our Monday locations expecting our Jamaica Plain friends to run sometimes upwards of 12-13 miles just to get to-and-back from the workout. Today, we made amends by selecting Jamaica Pond as our #DestinationDeck location. \n\nWe woke up to an inch thick sheet of ice covering the streets of Boston which made our running stride shorter, our attention pointed away from the tranquil surrounding of Boston at 6:00am to the icy roads under our feet. At 6:30am BG led a short warmup, divided the groups into two camps, and described the workouts. One camp was doing side shuffles in 6 inches of snow, while the other one was doing partner Jesus Jumps (exercise stolen from NP_MSN playbook). \n\nThis workout engaged quads, hamstrings, abs, hip flexors and everyone\u2019s favorite \u2013 booty muscles for solid 16 minutes. After few hugs and the Positivity and Helping-Hand Award presentation ceremony, we took the group photo and ran back to our respective showers ready to take on the world.

Out of the flames our brightly coloured tribe braved the chilly 6.6\u00b0C degrees to take on Push Up, Throw Down, Throw Up 100. It was a riot of colour as our tribespeople sprinted the 9, 18, and 27 meters between intervals of 20 partner push ups and throw downs (not the WWE style, we do ours for abs). We capped off the workout with a Midget Hump (only 804.6 meters) to prepare for the upcoming PR workout and I swear we made a double rainbow\u2026what does it mean?! \n\nMajor props to our MVPs today, wear those golden capes well!

That\u2019s not true, actually. There are many stairs left to climb, which is good because we are going to be climbing again next Wednesday.\n\n**THURSDAY**: Meet us at the Pint Downtownat 7:00pm.

We here in DC like to consider ourselves just as #weatherproof as our more northern tribe members and braved the cold like it was no big deal. Actually, it felt quite balmy once we started moving and the sunrise was definitely something you didn\u2019t want to miss. Our 5:30am group continues to grow and represent the most badass of racers. Today was another round of the McEnroe workout (for tennis lovers and haters alike): running the stairs and doing partner workouts in between logs (one up and down on the steps). This consists of push-ups, burpees, air squats, partner plank, sprint to Abe, and our new favorite hop to Abe. Recruiting papers were distributed and the homework for the week was to recruit someone with your new fancy recruiting papers. RECRUIT, RECRUIT, RECRUIT. Tell everyone about how much fun you have, how awesome the people are, and how awesome they are. We\u2019re just trying to gather all the awesome/crazy/fun people in DC. We then sent everyone on their merry way, glowing in the sun and the cold. \n\n**ANNOUNCEMENT**: Show up next week prepared for #Mugshots. We\u2019re taking photos of everyone and making an album. Get serious, go crazy, make a sign. GET WEIRD. And bring your friends. \n\n**WISCONSIN NOTES**  \n_by The G Boys_\n\nOur Tribe of 25ish souls (a few left early\u2026Jeff Mack) would not let the slippery slopes of the windy hill stop them from having the best start to the day anyone could ask for. Our hard workout was a new take on a reoccurring one that allowed us to play in the snow a little bit and we even got to catch some snow flakes on our tongues for the finale. Hell of a morning and we can not wait to see you all on Friday for a workout run by the Pat Bauch. He is gorgeous and smart so be there or be square.\n\n**DENVER NOTES**  \nby Flannel Dan\n\nNP1609m had an impressive turnout of newbies, ehh, despite the negative 10\u00b0C morning temp. No new snow to report, though we are quite jealous of our eastern tribe mates that got doused with freshies that we\u2019ve been toquing for. Today, the boys faced off against the girls in a \u2018who runs in flannel better\u2019 battle. Both teams ran figure-8s across our amphitheater for 20-minutes, tallying up the number of completed 8s. The ladies team, captained by first-timer, Ivy, took a commanding lead thanks in part to having a squad twice the size of the dudes. Not to be outdone, the gentlemen, led by birthday boy, Cisco, fought from behind as the teams faced-off in a dual of Lumberjack Sebastians (seven glorious minutes of Burpees while wearing flannel). The third and final element of the competition obviously was the Flannel Flair count. Each team has been awarded a point for each piece of flannel attire worn \u2013 shirts, pants, scarfs, hats, onesies. Results will be posted later. The Denver tribe was warm and fuzzy this morning. Don\u2019t be a hoser, join us next week!\n\n**BOSTON NOTES**:  \n_by Bojan_\n\nPhoto by Alan Scherer\n\nPhoto by Alan Scherer\n\nCombination of snow and rain that pooped all over Boston in the past few days conveniently turned to ice in the sub 0\u00b0C temperatures over night. This magical wonder of nature left the concrete steps of our beloved stadium nice and slippery just waiting for someone to crack their skull open. Since safety is our 3rd priority (right after tuning to jams on and up as soon as we get into the car, and checking twitter feed as soon as we open our eyes), we decided to move the workout over to the track. It seemed like the tribe was not disappointed. Our relatively short track workout of 25 minutes switched between doing burpees and 400m laps between partners. Was it hard? Well, let\u2019s put it this way, with the windchill of -12\u00b0C not a single person complained about cold. \n\nOn Friday you will be led into the battle of [Brookline hills](/summit-ave/) by very competent and charismatic Evan and Amanda.

He is tall, smart, gentle and soft-spoken. Ladies and gentleman, his name is Kreg Pearless and he tells us a few things about November Project and himself as a part of it.**\n\nWhen Brogan asked me to put some words down on paper about November Project I thought it would be easy. It could be about \u201canything\u201d \u2013 he just wanted it to be my story. I had a few thoughts: \n\n\\- Tell them about the time you accidentally started NP-Chicago by doing a Deck in O\u2019Hare Airport  \n\\- Write about your first day at NP and being humbled by how easily Claire Wood and Goldie Kaufenberg kicked your ass (let\u2019s be honest \u2013 they still kick my ass)  \n\\- Talk about how \u2026\n\n\u2026 At some point it occurred to me that, while these stories mattered, none of them could capture the immensity of November Project and what it has become. Sure, it would get the job done; one of them would be good enough to get on the blog, and they are certainly part of the NP story. But I wanted to unravel what November Project is at its core\u2026\n\n**Okay Kreg: So how does one capture the ethos of NP?**\n\n_(Damn \u2013 I should have stuck with Brogan\u2019s original question)_\n\nIf I may be so bold\u2026 here is my, albeit brief, attempt to untie this Gordian Knot. \n\nI believe, as many of you reading this believe, that NP is special. It transcends each and every one of us. Yes, Bojan and Brogan are the unquestioned leaders and heart of it, but it\u2019s also greater than them. They\u2019ve turned too many people on to the power of positivity, community, and accidentally getting fit at the same time. Just ask Rich in Arkansas \u2013 [you don\u2019t have to be in Boston to be part of this](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=457228541052249&set=a.252544108187361.50817.246449015463537&type=1&relevant_count=1).\n\nIs it the hugs? Is it the people? Are B&B really just the baddest workout dudes in history? It\u2019s most definitely not Kreg Pearless\u2026 As I searched for clarity, I stumbled upon this dude\u2026 (Watch his Tedx talk here). I would summarize his comments through the following quote:\n\nThe truth is that \u201cit\u2019s not necessarily reality that shapes us, but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality. And if you can change the lens\u2026\u201d you not only alter your happiness; you can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time. \n\n(Follow that link \u2013 [Watch the Tedx talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/shawn_achor_the_happy_secret_to_better_work.html) \u2013 read that paragraph again)\n\nSo here\u2019s the deal\u2026\n\nBrogan and Bojan didn\u2019t magically solve the code on how to get fit \u2013 the genius of B&B is they inadvertently? re-wrote the equation on happiness. Fitness, Hugs, Smiles, and the \u201cI\u2019m glad that you\u2019re here\u201d speeches, all play into this. Your brain is getting re-wired every M/W/F and you don\u2019t even know it. It\u2019s like this\u2026 \n\n\\- **So you think you\u2019re tired at section 12 of the stadium?** Just gut it out for another 11 sections and get to section 1; there you\u2019ll find an army of fun, smiling, good looking, encouraging individuals waiting to emotionally lift you through the hardest & best part of your day. \n\n\\- **Stuck walking half-way up the mountain known as Summit Ave?** No problem, it\u2019s only a matter of time until Grady, Jake Otto, Morgan Brown, or Big Smooth comes up behind you to tell you how great you\u2019re doing. These are some of the fittest people you will ever meet, and they are encouraging, not intimidating. And btw, don\u2019t sweat walking up the hill, 95% of the (non-NP) folks we know couldn\u2019t make it up that hill either\u2026 \n\nSpend a couple mornings with November Project and that 2-O\u2019clock bitch session from your boss doesn\u2019t seem so bad\u2026 Suddenly you\u2019re smiling at people on the street. If you\u2019ve noticed yourself being more content these days \u2013 you have NP to thank. \n\nThis all may sound wonky but it\u2019s been proven time and again to be true\u2026\n\nOkay, okay, okay\u2026 I get it \u2013 For many of us the November Project tag is a badge of honor. It\u2019s a, \u201cif you can make it here, you can make it anywhere\u201d kind of workout. It\u2019s a club that anyone can join but a challenge that few rise (quite literally) to accept. Every week we tell our friends, co-workers, worst enemies how they need to just SHOW-UP to a destination deck or Harvard Stadium to see what they\u2019re missing\u2026 \n\nThat\u2019s all true \u2013 Actually, it\u2019s the reason I started doing NP \u2013 but you and I can find a fitness club anywhere. Heck there are a dozen groups that workout AT HARVARD STADIUM alone \u2013 You don\u2019t need to be part of November Project in order to run the stadium. But no other Harvard Group is the size or scale of NP. I think you have to ask yourself what makes NP different and more popular than the others? It certainly isn\u2019t because NP starts at a better time of day\u2026 \n\nI remember telling Brogan, early-on, that \u201cyes, this is a cult\u201d. (I think he took it the wrong way but that\u2019s another story). The narrative of NP isn\u2019t that BG & BM are vanguards of free fitness \u2013 they\u2019re on a mission to make everyone around them, their city, and really the world a better place. We all showed up to challenge ourselves and our understanding of \u2018working out\u2019 but we walked away with much more\u2026\n\n**_Optional Reading Below: _**\n\n**And finally \u2013 what you\u2019ve all been waiting for: Kreg interviews himself\u2026 10 questions about NP\u2026**\n\n**Kreg what\u2019s the best part of November Project?**  \n\\- The people\u2026 hands down THE PEOPLE. The workouts can be done (almost) anywhere but when you have a community of individuals who will challenge you, support you, and make sure you smile (at least some point) along the way\u2026 That\u2019s worth it. Those of you who have tried to conquer Summit Ave by yourself, know what I mean.\n\n**Kreg, I\u2019m not like you, you love working out.**  \n\\- No, I effn\u2019 hate it\u2026 Just ask anyone who\u2019s ever run hills with me. And the fact is I\u2019d rather be doing almost anything other than 200 pushups & 200 sit-ups. But my genetics aren\u2019t that good and I like to eat more than you\u2026 Plus \u2013 the PEOPLE\n\n**Kreg, I don\u2019t like waking up early.**  \n\\- Don\u2019t like waking up early?

If you\u2019re in bed by 7pm \u2013 getting up at 5:30am isn\u2019t that hard.\n\n**Kreg, I can\u2019t find you on Facebook. What\u2019s up with that?**  \n\\- What\u2019s Facebook? Next Question\u2026\n\n**Is NP for everyone?**  \n\\- No it\u2019s not for EVERYONE\u2026  \n\u2022 Don\u2019t show up if you think you\u2019ll be faster/stronger than everyone there  \n\u2022 Don\u2019t show up if you hate fun  \n\u2022 Don\u2019t show up if you have aphephobia\n\n**So why did you do a deck at O\u2019Hare Airport?**  \n\\- Well Why Not?

I\u2019ve watched her over the last few years start as a skeptic, transform into an athlete, and grow from negative to neutral to full supporter of our movement. She and I went for a 1.5 mile run two years ago and we were forced to stop and take many rest breaks before we were done. Fast forward two years and Emilie has found her way to the finish of countless 10K\u2019s, #FrogMan1\u2032s, and even a few half marathons. Her progress as a runner is an entire story in itself and I couldn\u2019t be more proud to have watched from the sidelines. I am also very happy to see that we\u2019re actually getting this post up and live _without_ her husband and my dude (Bojan) knowing about it. This is the annoying/awesome November Project seen through the eyes of a Emilie Madaric: \n\nBrogan asked me to write a guest post for NP and keep it a secret from Bojan. As I rarely get the opportunity to surprise Bojan, I said yes. I sat down and typed out my thoughts, then erased them, then re-typed them, and then walked away and tried again. Finally, this logorrhoea (<\\-- the true \"medical\" term for \"word vomit\") dialogue was born...\n\nAt this point, I think we all know what November Project means to a lot of the tribes-people. It means hugs, friends, kick ass work outs, race PR's,and, let\u2019s be honest; looking better naked... and maybe sharing that with someone. What November Project means to me, as the wife of one of the co-founders, is many things. This has evolved over the past two years from hatred and intimidation to love and pride.  \nSo, keeping it real, let's talk about how regularly I've said \"I HATE NOVEMBER PROJECT\" in the beginning. It\u2019s true. November Project was an unstoppable force, figuratively barreling through my household, and my life. \n\n**1) We used to take vacations.** We now take November Project vacations. This means we travel to places that have current or prospective NP locations, and/or travel to places with killer stairs that we can crush, at 6:30am\u2026on vacation\u2026 \n\n**2) We used to have a normal amount of clothing.** We have earned so much free #grassrootsgear that it doesn\u2019t fit in our dresser drawers anymore\u2026 seriously, we need a third dresser just to hold our (awesome)tagged gear. \n\n**3) I used to have socially-appropriate boundaries.** I want to hug EVERYONE now. I was on a job interview last week, and when it was over I had to remind myself I shouldn\u2019t hug my interviewer. It\u2019s instinct now to stick my hand out and high five every runner I see running by. It\u2019s like I shit rainbows now. This is what NP has done to me. \n\n**4) I used to have free time.** We have met so many great people from all walks off life, and have endless opportunities to immerse ourselves in fun activities. Now our calendar is full; filled to the top.\n\n**5) I used to participate in \u201cnormal\u201d social activities.** I can run now\u2026 and do a full stadium\u2026 and do crow pose. Prior to NP I couldn\u2019t complete sixsections, run a mile, or even do onesun A. I am now expected to participate in 5k\u2019s, 10k\u2019s, even half marathons without much notice because I am an athlete now. Who have my friends become? \n\n**6) We used to have dinner dates.** My concept of romantic gestures is now all screwed up; it\u2019s gone from asurprise candle-lit dinner, my LBD (men: that\u2019s code for little black dress), and designer pumps to an early morning #weatherpoof half marathon in Hyannis in February and having my husband run the entire race next to me, cheering me on with soaking wet feet.\n\nAt this point in time, two years later, with seven cities and hundreds, perhaps thousands of people waking up to meet at 6:30am to sweat, love, and hug, November Project is still that unstoppable force barreling through my household and life, but it\u2019s a welcome one. I have to tell you the phrase \u201c**I hate November Project**\u201d has been eliminated from my vocabulary. I\u2019ve replaced it with \u201cI am so proud of my husband and Brogan; and all of us might be a bit crazy, **but I fucking love November Project**.\u201d If you invest one month, one day, one week, or even one hour with NP, getting to see what Bojan and Brogan have started, I think you too will drink the Kool Aid, hug it out, and proudly say \u201c**I Love November Project**\u201d (\u201cf-word\u201d optional, but highly encouraged).\n", "title": "I HATE NOVEMBER PROJECT, I LOVE NOVEMBER PROJECT by Emilie Mandaric", "url": "http://november-project.com/i-hate-november-project-i-love-november-project-by-emilie-mandaric/", "workout_entry": true, "author": "brogan", "location": "POINT (-71.0635000000000048 42.3581000000000003)", "date": "2013-12-07", "dow": 5}, "model": "novproj.post", "pk": 71}, {"fields": {"body": "**SAN FRANCISCO NOTES**  \n_by Laura_\n\nWord is spreading.

All subjects voluntarily participate in November Project. Lauren Goodman, a 33 year-old with a long history in competitive team sports, playing DI lacrosse in college. She was most definitely not an active (distance) runner so much so she had never run more than 6 miles prior to enlisting in November Project. Kelsey Taylor, a 24 year-old collector of vintage fanny packs, ran cross country and track competitively in college, but had failed to find a suitable (i.e. fast girls and shirtless men) group to continue running with upon moving to Boston. Renata Koziol, a 26 year-old former Russian gymnast, detested running as a high school track star, but flipped her way onto the November Project scene while working as a researcher in childhood obesity prevention. (Side note: Renata\u2019s parents and child prodigy sister were saddened to learn that she had joined a cult after her gymnast career ended in a tragic story that cannot be told.)\n\n**Table 1. Subjects**\n\n**Hypothesis**  \nTraining with the November Project Tribe supports one\u2019s consistency in competitive and active fitness and ability to achieve personal fitness goals.\n\n**Testing Procedures**  \nNovember Project MWF 6:30 AM Workouts-Destination Deck, Harvard Stadium & Summit Ave  \nTuesday #FenSpeed track workouts 6:30 AM  \nWeekly Saturday training runs 7AM (12-22 miles)  \nYoga Classes (for injury prevention)\n\n**Methodology**  \nSoon after joining November Project, Lauren Goodman realized she had finally found something amazing. She immediately called her parents exclaiming, \u201cI finally found freaks like me!\u201d She slowly made friends with Renata Koziol, who although shy at first, turned out to be an #UNSTOPPABLE force on the NP scene. Competitive in nature, Renata couldn\u2019t resist giving Kelsey Taylor the stink eye when on her first day, Kelsey proved herself by keeping up with Renata (who had been going for months) on the brutal loops of Summit Ave. It only took a few November Project workouts for the Lauren, Renata & Kelsey to each realize that they had finally found in each other just the right mixture of friendly competition & support to push themselves beyond their comfort zone. #raceeverything\n\n**Testing Procedures**  \nWhile Lauren had her sights on her first marathon at Boston that next month, Renata and Kelsey planned for their first marathon in the fall. Lauren missed qualifying on her first try by a mere 41 seconds! Determined to qualify for Boston, she joined her now good friends Kelsey and Renata through the long, sweltering summer of wicked early Saturday training runs. They trained through heat, rain, hangovers, and tons of injuries, skinned knees and way too many loops around Fresh Pond. On any given long run, one of the trio would undoubtedly be feeling slow, unmotivated or mentally burnt out, but having each other, they took turns supporting one another through the runs, ultimately getting up to 22 miles. Between 3 days of November Project, #FenSpeed Tuesday and Saturday long runs, they almost never had to train alone, which prior to November Project would NOT have been the case. Not long into their training, the trio realized that not only would they reach their goal of completing a marathon, but they could also achieve the strict qualifying times for Boston.\n\n**Results**  \nOn September 15, wearing her #GrassRootsGear Lauren redeemed herself running a blazing 3:28:24 to qualify for the 2014 Boston Marathon. However, she didn\u2019t see her work as complete; she was determined to see her good friends & training partners Renata and Kelsey through their first marathons a mere 3 weeks later. Renata and Kelsey got smutty with their 1st marathon at Smuttynose Rockfest, with no shortage of NP friends and family in attendance. Lauren ran 17 miles that day first pacing Danielle DeSiato-Hallman to her PR finish in the half marathon, and then supporting Renata through the last 7 miles to the marathon finish. With the strong and dedicated support of their NP tribe and each other, Kelsey finished with a BQ time of 3:34:48 with Renata shortly after at 3:37:34. The strength of their friendship, and the support they had for one another both within and outside of November Project led them to accomplish goals beyond their initial expectations. #FUCKYEAH\n\n**Table 2. Results**\n\n**Discussion**  \nThe purpose of this study was to examine if training with the November Project Tribe does in fact supports one\u2019s consistency in competitive and active fitness and ability to achieve personal fitness goals. Undoubtedly, we found that November Project can help members accomplish their personal fitness goals, with the trio of participants: Lauren, Kelsey, and Renata serving as only one example. However, as we reflected on our data, we\u2019ve realized that there is more to our results. In the aftermath of the Boston Marathon Bombings, a phrase was coined that brought together the community of Boston: \u201cBoston Strong\u201d. What is Boston Strong? An adjective? A noun? Maybe a verb? To us, Boston Strong is not an adjective \u2013 it is a noun that existed long before the phrase was actually coined; its a community of people who together with you find the strength to grow and become the best version of yourself, whether you define that physically (in the form of fitness/health goals), emotionally, or otherwise. Lauren, Renata, and Kelsey each found their BostonStrong in November Project, where not only did they accomplish their marathon goals, but they have formed life changing friendships. The tribe has become their extended family, and 6:30 AM their new favorite time of the day. Not everyone will find their BostonStrong in November Project. Some may find it in their community gardens, book clubs, or biker gangs. One thing we know for certain, though, you\u2019ll never find BostonStrong at the gym, alone on a treadmill with your headphones on. So let us answer the question we know you\u2019re all asking: \u201cWill I find Boston/Madison/Edmonton/DC/SD/SF/Denver Strong at November Project?\u201d. You\u2019ll never know until you try. See you at 6:30 AM for the start of your case study.\n\n#TheTribeisBostonStrong\n", "title": "November Project Case Study", "url": "http://november-project.com/november-project-case-study/", "workout_entry": true, "author": "bojan", "location": "POINT (-71.0635000000000048 42.3581000000000003)", "date": "2013-12-05", "dow": 3}, "model": "novproj.post", "pk": 73}, {"fields": {"body": "**1\\. November Project DC**  \nThe tribe here in DC continues to be strong. Fresh faces were greeted with hugs and then all paired up for some speed dating.

Big hype for our [#RecruitingPapers event this Friday](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJ7fpe0b3s) (for full details see NPDC\u2019s Facebook event) and a reminder to everyone that our Wednesday 5:30AM group has started and is going strong.

November Project Boston**  \nThis is the PG-13 version of my original post: Its BG and I\u2019m happy to say that its December here in Boston. Because today is the first Wednesday of the month we did the climbing classic called [#FrogMan1](http://november-project.com/frogman1/) (formerly known as \u201cthe hiking trip\u201d) which is a total of 50 sections of the Harvard Stadium. The cold has actually made us colder and we\u2019ve added a time cutoff so that we can jam pack everyone into a group photo, sitting the hot and recently active next to the finished and nearly frozen. This grand finale snapshot helped to get everyone on their way. Was this unfair to the less-speedy kids in the group? Maybe a little. Will they get more sections completed in the first week of January knowing that the group photo is coming? Absolutely. Please notice that our Boston photo style will remain black and white all month as we close out 2013. In 2014 we\u2019ll bring in the bright New Year and you\u2019ll see an explosion of color. With this in mind, get a lot of neon/bright gear for the holiday self-giving season in order to stand out in 2014. And one last thing\u2026 I refuse to fact check with Bojan on this and I\u2019m going to just tell you what\u2019s on my mind: **The tribe is strong**. \n\n**3\\. November Project Madison**  \nMy name is Ted Gurman. I lead the November Project tribe here in Madison no matter what. As for today\u2019s workout: It was rainy, not very cold, and rather dark, but we took some time to lay in the puddles and have a blast. **The tribe is wet and strong**. Mostly strong. Again, my name is literally Ted Gurman, and I approve the message. \n\n**4\\. November Project Denver**  \nMove over Victoria\u2019s Secret models, Denver\u2019s got their own Angels who graced a frigid runway this morning to further sculpt their heavily layered bodies. Despite the smack of single digit temps and the anticipation of snowfall, the tribe held nothing back as they attacked a circuit workout aptly named \u2018**Snowballs Chance in Hell**\u2019. Since we are all angels, there were no snowballs thrown and what should have felt like hell was actually heaven. Nonetheless, we jumped our way up the stadium seats, bear-crawled down, and then ran to the center of the Amphitheater as Dan pontificated about his vision of a future that does not yet exist and how every tribe member is a purple cow. That was weird, but then we kept running, jumping, and crawling.\n\nThanks to NP-YEG\u2019s winter layering tips for keeping the tribe toasty warm this morning with our toques and ample supply of baklava. This message was built 1 or more miles above sea level. \n\n**5\\. November Project Edmonton** Newbies in -28C (-20F)!  \nWhen it gets this cold we show up with a thousand layers. By the end of the workout, hundreds of those layers are lying on the ground. Fortunately, it\u2019s just the layers, and not the tribe that\u2019s on the ground. Why? Because the tribe is strong! Originally, the plan today was to have everyone do a giant hug, and then all go up the stairs together. Body heat saves lives! Since the stairs aren\u2019t wide enough to actually do that, we tried to outrun the wind instead. I\u2019m not saying we outran it, I\u2019m just saying that we barely noticed it.

November Project San Francisco**  \nAlamo Square felt different this morning, my friends. The fog rolled slowly in off the bay. The sun rose cautiously over the hills. Men and women trudged knowingly, stoic, towards the park. That same gentle earth that once nurtured camaraderie and solidarity, today lay unforgiving and cold, festering with bitterness and division. There was a palpable shift in energy. A wicked brew, two parts estrogen, two parts testosterone, fermented violently on the battle field. It stung your nostrils, made your hair stand on end and your ass cheeks clench so tight you could turn a lump of coal into a diamond. Those that laid witness knew that today, December 4th, would live in infamy. For today we held \u2026 THE BATTLE OF THE SEXES!\n\nActually, today was slightly more akin to a reality dating show than a battle of the sexes. Sorry ya\u2019ll, we may have over-hyped this one, that\u2019s on us. Incidentally, if you left your nunchuks in the park, we have them. We separated the tribe into men and women, which immediately made it clear that we have WAY more ladies than gents. What\u2019s with that dudes? Where are you? Why is it so hard to find a nice, athletic, single guy in this city?! Oh that\u2019s right, their all already dating Laura.\n\nMen and women faced off with a series of different exercises and then lapped the park in opposite directions, pairing up with the first member of the opposite sex to cross their path. Pairs then returned to the center of the park for a series of cringe-worthy partner assisted drills. They came expecting a battle, they instead did squat-jump high-fives and giggled at each other. So which is the superior sex? We may never know\u2026\n\nTHIS FRIDAY! 6:27 AM. Hills baby. Divisadero and Lombard Street. Don\u2019t miss it!

This week down south where we deep-fry our turkeys we had PR WEEK and a reminder as to why the November Project started. 35 badass racers came out, #weatherproof, to track their progress running \u201cLincoln Logs,\u201d trying to best last months PR week. Holiday transplants were REPPIN\u2019 in DC today as we had Megan2, Salina, Melly, and Ben making their holiday rounds to the DCA_TRIBE. Also shout out to TJ, highschooler from Alexandria showing up, shorts and t-shirt, and chatting up the older women. Kid\u2019s got game. Also introduced \u201cLog Champ;\u201d whoever runs the most logs during PR week gets crowned log champ of the month and has to wear the top hat during the next three workouts. \n\nQuick serious note: Days like this \u2013 when the sun doesn\u2019t rise until after the workouts done, its frigid cold, and the weather channel broadcasts this as snowpocalypse 2.0 \u2013 we remember why 2 dudes in Boston made this pack. When you verbal, just show up, say fuck it to the weather, you build something bigger than working out or going out for drinks. You build a community full of smiles, hugs, and awesome tushies. \n\nDCA_OUT\n\n**SAN FRANCISCO NOTES**:  \n_by Laura_\n\nTraveler\u2019s from the east and newbies from the land of Fillmore street came out today to prove their might and strength on PR Wednesday. Frankly (Can I call you Frank?), this surprised the fck out of Laura who honestly envisioned her and Clayton racing each other in Alamo solo while you all prepared for your feasts. So imagine her delight! Pictured above is our pathetic impression of a bird most of us will be eating tomorrow. Although, this is SF, so the meal will probably be tofu burgers with locally grown, organic micro greens, with a gluten-free rice pudding for dessert. Because that\u2019s how we roll. HAPPY THANKSGIVING! I am thankful for all of YOU! And peanut butter. Incredibly thankful of peanut butter.\n\n**EDMONTON NOTES**:  \n_by Nadim_\n\nThere\u2019s no better way to start off your morning than with a race, especially, if you\u2019re a newbie! Jesse was so excited about trying it out, he called in to his favourite radio station to tell them he was driving around town to find someone to hug. Luckily, he stumbled on a set of misfits, known as the November Project. We then made him race up and down the stairs as he set his own PB (it counts if it\u2019s your first). It mixed well with the jam that Owen brought this morning!\n\nThe Champ award goes to Billy again for defending his title of fastest to finish 10 sets (30:52). Yes, the youngest person on the stairs is the champ. Race times will be posted tonight along with the photos.\n\nFriday is Jersey day (sports uniform) at Emily Murphy Park!\n\nWas it something I said? Why was everyone telling me to talk to the hand in our photo?\n\n**DENVER NOTES**:  \n_by Dan_\n\nColorado Love. This morning the tribe was greeted by a magical lightshow draped over Denver\u2019s Capitol Building. After our strobe-induced hallucinations subsided, we raced like turkeys for 32-minutes, lapping the Clover circuit. Organized mayhem is how onlookers described the morning scene at Civic Center Amphitheater, as we attacked the stadium seats, traversed from section to section, and sprinted across the promenade. Congrats to Ryan \u2018Baby Face\u2019 Wooderson, who threw down 13-laps, #ChallengeAccepted.\n\nThe tribe hugged some newbies today, greeted some out-of-towners back for the holiday, and saluted those who broke their verbal promise. Rather than guilt trip those who were absent, the November Project Denver mascot, Lark Bunting, (look it up) will be squawking on your shoulder as you reach in for that second helping of pecan pie tomorrow.\n\n**SAN DIEGO NOTES**:  \n_by Jessica_\n\nToday was a great day. By 7:30am, the San Diego tribe had already rocked the day. How many people have YOU hugged today? If you got your fine ass to Kate Sessions Park this morning you had 66 friends to hug, sweat and be awesome with. The Final Hump was dominated today! The tribe as whole shaved off 3+ minutes from our overall time and our Plank Challenge PR doubled \u2013 we had to cap off our top three bodacious females and single rock-solid male at 11minutes! Ya\u2019ll are are animals! \n\nI couldn\u2019t be more proud of our neon tribespeople today with the exceptional love and generosity demonstrated by the donations for Baby Reefy \u2013 because of NPSD this family will hopefully have a wonderful Thanksgiving and be stocked for weeks to come! \n\nIncase you were still in a coma at 6:31, and didn\u2019t notice the slightly taller gentleman bouncing up and down \u2013 NP co-founder Brogan brought some East Coast spice to SD this morning (and we\u2019re not just talking about Golide!) It was a blast to have you guys here, get in touch with our roots and get PSYCHED about the future! \n\nEveryone have an epic Thanksgiving \u2013 I for one am thankful for ALL OF YOU! See everyone next week!\n\nYa\u2019ll good San Diego?  \nFuck Yeah!\n\n**MADISON NOTES**  \n_by The G Boys_\n\nOur awesome group of 50-60ish people (Daniel Birk Graham didn\u2019t count today) got up despite the stiff wind and snow covered ground and worked their asses off.

On this beautiful Saturday only a day away from the groundbreaking [#SceneBeSeen](http://november-project.com/scene-be-seen/), we are proud to bring you\u2026 **Allie Marie Hall**._\n\nI was first invited to November Project in May of 2012, but admittedly I didn\u2019t show up as a Newbie until early June because\u2026well, I was intimidated by the fact that the people who invited me to this \u201cworkout\u201d were ripped and long legged \u2013 i.e Goldie, Scott and Brando. While box jumps and burpess are this short person\u2019s friend, I truly thought that my legs were too short to actually \u201crun\u201d the stadium. I wasn\u2019t even worried about \u201ckeeping up,\u201d but rather, about finishing in a respectable amount of time, which I was certain would be a good couple hours after everyone else! While Scott finished in half the time it took me, it was immediately apparent that NP was not about competition but rather about community and getting out of your comfort zone. And, as a result I quickly learned that even short people can run up the stadium stairs.\n\nOver the next four months NP quickly grew. From 25 to 55 to 100 and then 300 members. And to be honest, I wasn\u2019t that surprised. The motivation that you get knowing there is a group of people who are going to come out, rain or shine, and run alongside you is infectious.\n\nUnfortunately, the hardest part of NP is right around the corner, it goes to the core of how it all started \u2013 waking up to a foot of snow and having the motivation to simply **GET UP**. I admit, I failed at this last winter and became almost non-existent at NP. My only advice is to prepare now, physically and most important mentally. We are reminded all the time by Bojan and BG but here is a recap:\n\n1\\. Don\u2019t Make Excuses, just show up: 99% of us are NOT morning people, we just don\u2019t make excuses to stay in bed. Everyone has to travel through the same crappy weather to get to the workout, so ignore that voice inside your head telling you to stay in bed and get your ace up!\n\n2\\. Use The Buddy System: our Founders will be at every workout, but what will motivate you to get there? Find people who live near you and do the following: carpool, bike, MBTA, Hubway, whatever.\n\n3\\. Disconnect: Turn off the TV, cell phone, iPad, computer, etc. and get some sleep. Its 1000% easier to get up and get motivated if you aren\u2019t dog tired.\n\n4\\. Warm Up: Buy some warm clothes, if you know you won\u2019t freeze your ace off before you get to the workout you will be much more motivated to get it out the door. \n\nThe tribe is strong\u2026 Lets keep it that way, all winter long!\n", "title": "Tiny Legs & Her Tribe Head Into Winter \u2013 Allie Maire Hall", "url": "http://november-project.com/tiny-legs-her-tribe-head-into-winter-allie-maire-hall/", "workout_entry": true, "author": "brogan", "location": "POINT (-71.0635000000000048 42.3581000000000003)", "date": "2013-11-23", "dow": 5}, "model": "novproj.post", "pk": 79}, {"fields": {"body": "**BOSTON NOTES**:  \n_by Bojan_\n\nDear friends born on November 22 that came to todays workout hoping to get some version of a BOOM as a recognition of your birthday, we want to say we\u2019re sorry.

He rides his bike from Bucksborough (or some town in MA) to Boston no matter what the conditions are. He has three kids, probably a hot wife, and a creative mind. We met Mike during the very first stages of working with New Balance for a project called [#Runnovation](http://november-project.com/boston/) which turned out to be amazing for all parties. Well, we\u2019ll let Mike tell the story\u2026 ladies and gents, this is Mike Howard and his full experience with November Project. **\n\nHey kids, did I ever tell you about the time Brogan and Bojan asked me for a million bucks? \n\nOkay, in truth, it wasn\u2019t exactly a million. It was somewhere in the mid-to-high nines, as I recall \u2013 a number close enough to a million without having the audacity to actually be a million. And if I\u2019m being completely honest, they didn\u2019t exactly ask me for it. Not at all, actually.\n\nBut I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. Let me back up.\n\nThe first time I met Brogan it wasn\u2019t against the epic backdrop of Harvard Stadium. No, instead I met him in a humble conference room in Brighton. \n\nFor those of you who\u2019ve never experienced Brogan indoors, suffice it to say there are issues of scale with which one must contend. People like Brogan aren\u2019t supposed to occupy humble conference rooms in Brighton, or anywhere else for that matter. He entered, and I swear about five people had to leave just to accommodate him.\n\nLet me just state for the record, I\u2019ve always been the kind of guy who feels perfectly comfortable owning a man crush. I think it\u2019s a healthy thing to acknowledge. I mean, I\u2019m a very happily married father of three lovely little girls, but come on! If you\u2019re a dude, and you know Brogan, you know exactly what I\u2019m talking about. \n\nSo in walks this guy, made of pure thunder and charisma (roll the R, for full effect). He\u2019s ten feet tall if he\u2019s an inch, his limbs are covered in several square yards of gnarly tats, he\u2019s got the whole chiseled jaw thing going on, and an 18-pack that\u2019s fully apparent even under a down jacket. So when I reach out for a handshake and he leans in (and way, way down) for a bear hug instead, well, it\u2019s pretty much all over. I\u2019ve got a full-on raging broner.\n\nBut as it turns out, the most appealing, magnetic thing about Brogan was that he and his mysterious Serbian shadow cohort, Bojan, had stumbled onto something for which they were obviously, and uniquely intended \u2013 something for which it seemed they were put on Earth. People spend their whole lives oblivious to their \u201csomething.\u201d Maybe they never find it. Maybe they never even bother to try. But these guys had it. And they believed in it with all their heart.\n\nMoreover, they weren\u2019t content to simply write off their \u201csomething\u201d as the product of accidental or serendipitous circumstance. Instead, they\u2019d taken the time and initiative to examine it. To analyze it. To decode, identify, and isolate the specialness of their something.\n\nAnd over the course of the next I-don\u2019t-know-how-long, Brogan set about communicating his research findings, spewing his cult of personality all over the humble conference room and its occupants while pitching us on his grand plans for the November Project and its eventual global takeover.\n\nThe insights he shared were thoughtful ones. They\u2019d observed, for example, how the confined dynamic of the stadium and Summit Avenue allowed for friendly competition while at the same time, neutralizing it \u2013 allowing less competitive folks to melt in unselfconsciously amid the waves of ascending and descending bodies. \n\nThey also observed how this dynamic facilitated social interaction. Rather than just passing the same runner once a day along the Esplanade with little more than a polite nod of the head at best, in the stadium, you pass the same people often enough to force interaction. To not interact would be awkward. And eventually, that interaction becomes second nature. Comfortable, even.\n\nHe shared their thoughts on an optimal female-to-male ratio (\u201cAbout 60/40. Girls like working out with girls. Guys like working out with girls.\u201d), and the motivational power of shirtlessness and rock-hard booties.\n\nHe shared their totems and rituals \u2013 the hugs, the Fuck Yeah\u2019s, the oar handle inscribed with Sharpie, the grassroots gear \u2013 and the important and intentional role all of it plays.\n\nNovember Project, as he pitched it, was about fitness, yes. Undeniably, fundamentally, unrelentingly, this thing was about people pushing one another to dry heaves and then to the higher levels of awesomeness that lay beyond. \n\nNot insignificantly, it was also about free fitness. Indeed, \u201cfree\u201d was one of the core tenets of their movement. Damn the membership fees! Your world is your gym! Getting fit is your inalienable right!\n\nBut most importantly, they recognized the power of November Project as a community, above and beyond all else. You should all know this: If Brogan made one point most loudly, clearly, and explicitly in that humble conference room, it was that he and Bojan regard each and every member of their exponentially growing tribe as friends. Friends they would never under any circumstances betray, or exploit. They very clearly recognized that this fact, more than any other, set November Project apart from, and above all the boot camps and the running clubs out there. Community was their special sauce.\n\nAnd alas, therein lay the million-dollar rub, and the moral of this story. But once again, I\u2019m getting a little ahead of myself. Bear with me.\n\nThe truth is I already knew a whole lot about this November Project thing, because I\u2019d already been stalking all of you for months. It started about a year ago. A colleague of mine named Janeen was leaving for a new job in New York. On her last day she came into my office, wrote the words, \u201cNovember Project. Check it out.\u201d on a Post-it, and stuck it to the screen of my laptop. \n\nSo I did. I checked it out. In the online-y sense, anyway. And then I \u201cliked\u201d you, and I \u201cfollowed\u201d you. I enjoyed your pictures and videos, the blog posts, and the hash tags. I discovered other friends and colleagues were also passionately involved, and as online stalking goes, it was a delightful experience. Thank you! Seeing you all having fun together never failed to either inspire me to go out and play, or to frustrate me because I was stuck in my fucking office.\n\nI wanted to participate, too. I don\u2019t want to diminish that fact in the least. I love shit like this, which is part of why Janeen stuck that sticky note in the first place. But to be honest, I wasn\u2019t necessarily in the market for another community to which I could belong. Again, I\u2019m a husband and a dad. My oldest daughter was just turning eight, and my younger twin girls were just two years old. So I was (and am) a little busy with all that.\n\nNor did I need any particular motivation being #weatherproof. I live in the suburbs about 12 miles west of Boston, and since 2008, I\u2019ve ridden my bicycle to and from work more or less every day, year-round. I take a lot of pride in my motivation during the winter months, and I felt a philosophical kinship with November Project in that way. I relish the fact that people think I\u2019m crazy for getting out there in the hell and the high water. I suspect you guys take some pleasure in that, as well. Winter in New England will suffocate you if you don\u2019t get out and embrace it. We\u2019re not the crazy ones, they are.\n\nStill, I really did want to participate. It didn\u2019t help that I was going through something of a midlife crisis \u2013 coming to grips with the fact that my life didn\u2019t accommodate certain freedoms anymore. Here was yet another party I could not attend. Another spontaneous adventure I couldn\u2019t embark upon. I wanted to participate. But I didn\u2019t feel I could. So I never did. \n\nThen came that meeting in the humble conference room when my orbit intersected with November Project.\n\nNeither I, nor any member of my team initiated the meeting. Claire Wood did. You guys all know Claire, of course. She\u2019s November Project to the core, and she also works for a certain Boston-based athletic shoe company that rhymes with \u201cLou Valance,\u201d a famous Vegas lounge singer I just now made up. Her company is also a client of mine, and my team was there as a communication partner.\n\nThe purpose of the meeting was a bit vague. It was an introduction, certainly. Ostensibly it was about striking up some sort of a partnership and, at least to me, it made complete sense. I mean on the one hand, here\u2019s this Boston-based athletic company with a sense of local pride at the core of its global presence. On the other, we\u2019ve got these guys who\u2019ve started a bona-fide fitness phenomenon right in their back yards. These two parties should at least share a dance, shouldn\u2019t they?\n\nGood impressions were made, hugs were exchanged, and the meeting concluded, more or less thusly: \u201cGuys, we love you. What exactly do you propose? Put it on paper, in detail, and let\u2019s talk again.\u201d\n\nBrogan then left the humble conference room and returned, one can only imagine, to Mount Olympus where Bojan had been waiting for him. The two then did what they were asked. Very meticulously and thoughtfully, they drew up a proposal, complete with carefully itemized budget items, for this Boston-based athletic company to aid in the worldwide development of the November Project brand.\n\nThe sum total of their proposal? You guessed it. Just shy of a million dollars.\n\nA million dollars! A million dollars?! Seriously? The audacity! The nerve! Are these guys delusional?\n\nLet\u2019s just say, the other side of the table was not super receptive.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Of course, they asked for a million dollars! What the fuck else were they supposed to do?\n\nThey\u2019d been charged with putting a number on their life\u2019s calling. This thing that had come to mean so much to these two guys \u2013 this thing that had come to define their lives and their friendships, into which they\u2019d poured so much effort and energy \u2013 they were being asked to put a price tag on it. What would you do? \n\nWould you lowball your own passion?\n\nBrogan and Bojan weren\u2019t armed with even a vague context. They didn\u2019t know how their million-dollar ask compared to other athletic sponsorships. They didn\u2019t know how it compared to other marketing efforts. And most of all, they didn\u2019t know if another chance like this was ever going to come along. So they did what they thought was right, and did their level best to do themselves and their November Project justice.\n\nShortly after the ill-fated proposal, I received an email from Brogan. He wanted to talk and suggested we meet for coffee. It was a Sunday, February 17. The next day was President\u2019s Day. I had the day off, so I told him I\u2019d go do his workout and we could have coffee after that.\n\nThe Destination Deck was down on the wharf at the Children\u2019s Museum, and it was fucking cold. How cold? Hold up; let me check with my Internet. Yep, it was about 16 degrees. \n\nThe ride from my home through the morning darkness was bleak and lonely. The loneliness is significant. See, November Project starts at 6:30 AM sharp. So if you\u2019re traveling any distance to the location in the dead of winter (particularly if you\u2019re traveling by bike), getting out of bed is only the first psychological obstacle to overcome. \n\nThe turnout that day was not epic. Of course, it was a holiday, and it was Monday, and again, it was 16 de-fucking-grees out. Still, given all that, they managed to draw numbers I estimated in the low triple digits. It was impressive.\n\nThe workout? In a word: Humiliating. There are pictures. Sad, unfortunate pictures. The ignominy is etched into my psyche. I\u2019ve run marathons. I am an avid cyclist. When I was in high school\u2026no. NO! I will not invoke high school accomplishments in my defense. Let\u2019s just say, if you\u2019ve been taking for granted your ability to push and/or sit up without testing that ability recently, you\u2019re gonna be a little crestfallen after a Monday with November Project.\n\nAfter my fitness Come-to-Jesus, Brogan and I had coffee around the corner. The sun had risen and the loneliness of the day was melting away. We got to know each other a little better, and talked about things like monetization and scalability. We discussed analogous business models, and their dreams for this thing to become a full-time enterprise.\n\nI asked why he didn\u2019t start by just throwing up a \u201cshop\u201d tab on his blog. At the very least. Just make some tee shirts, maybe a winter beanie or something. Start super simple and see what happens. \u201cYour people love this thing,\u201d I said. \u201cThey want it to succeed. They would buy a freakin\u2019 tee-shirt from you, no doubt about it.\u201d\n\nHe said they\u2019d talked about it, but that they were already doing this Grassroots gear thing \u2013 spray painting a stencil of their logo on athletic gear people already own \u2013 and it had become part of their culture.\n\nOkay, well what about co-branded merchandise? Like, what if you struck a deal with, the aforementioned Boston-based athletic company to produce a line of November Project gear designed along the #weatherproof ethic (#weatherproof is another November Project-ism). Maybe you could just license your name? Talk to a lawyer. See how it\u2019s done.\n\nHe didn\u2019t find that palatable either. I can\u2019t recall exactly why, but as we bounced around other thoughts (Kickstarter? Alternative sponsorship model?), the primary themes of conversation all came back to authenticity. Staying true to the values that made November Project special in the first place was non-negotiable. They wouldn\u2019t take any chances on anything that might compromise the integrity of the beautiful thing they were building.\n\nThe more we talked, the more I understood their frustration. November Project is a very time consuming labor of love for Brogan and Bojan, but doing what you love for a living has never been more romanticized than it is today.\n\nWe\u2019re constantly being pumped full of lofty TED-talk and pithy Pinspiration. Steve Jobs\u2019 famous graduation speech at Stanford has well over 30 million views on YouTube. Everywhere we turn we\u2019re inspired by Fast-Company-ready stories of life passions translated into wealth, fame, and success.\n\nSo why should November Project be any different? It\u2019s nothing if not wildly entrepreneurial. And yet, by its very nature and code, it seems to defy monetization.\n\nOh, and there\u2019s also this rather substantial elephant in the room: How do you go about scaling Brogan and Bojan? Ask either of them and they will insist it can be done. Indeed, as more November Projects pop up around the country, who knows? Maybe they\u2019re right. But without those two enormous personalities, without Harvard Stadium, without this town needing something just like this, could November Project really be November Project?\n\nThese two young men had found their lightning. Finding the right bottle for it was proving more difficult.\n\nWhich, for me, begs the question: Does all lightning need to be bottled? Does it need to be mass-produced, shipped, marketed, advertised, and merchandised? As a culture, have we gone too far commoditizing our Passion\u2122? And have we cheapened it in the process?\n\nIn the end, the Boston-based athletic shoe company and the Boston-based grassroots fitness movement did share their dance, albeit without the million-dollar marriage. \n\nFor my part, it was an incredible experience. As an, \u201cAdvertising Professional,\u201d being involved with this thing and being entrusted, along with my team, to bring it to life genuinely and purely \u2013 to not fuck it up \u2013 forced me to examine what I do and the ethic with which I do it.\n\nI\u2019d like to think our November Project, um, \u201cproject\u201d helped contribute a little more to the fame of the thing, but I don\u2019t know. The guys were doing a pretty good job on the fame thing before we got mixed up with one another, and they\u2019re doing even better with it now. Either way, I\u2019m profoundly proud of the work we made together.\n\nAs a person \u2013 specifically as a 40+ year-old person \u2013 the experience has proven even more rewarding. After that bitter cold day in February, I continued to attend the workouts as regularly as I could. I\u2019m calling them \u201cworkouts,\u201d but I never thought of them that way. True to Brogan and Bojan\u2019s mission, it\u2019s become a valuable community to me, more than anything else. I\u2019ve met interesting and talented people with whom I never would\u2019ve come into contact with otherwise. I\u2019ve brought friends along. I\u2019ve even won that oar handle \u2013 the Positivity Award. \n\nIt\u2019s helped me become more connected to my larger community, too. I never used to think of Boston as my home. I was just biding my time until we left for Southern California, or New York, or who knows where. That\u2019s changed now. Now I can see the value I lend to this place \u2013 the value we all could lend if we would just decide not to flee for fairer climes. \n\nI was riding from a workout one morning with Brogan, talking about another plan he was concocting, and I remember he said, \u201cYeah, Boston could stand to be a whole lot cooler.\u201d I think with more people like him, and Bojan, and the rest of you, it stands a chance of fulfilling that promise of increased coolness. I like to say, \u201cBoston needs you more than you need New York.\u201d I think November Project is a shining example of that belief.\n\nWhile writing this, I was reminded of some of the early emails we traded back and forth. This one sums up my feelings then and now:\n\nYou\u2019re still young. You don\u2019t have mortgages or families yet. And this is the critical thing: what you\u2019re doing matters. It makes a real difference in people\u2019s lives.\n\nMy advice to you is this: Don\u2019t sell this passion of yours to fucking anyone.\n\nKeep building November Project (and your personal brands) using every connection and resource you\u2019ve got. \n\nGet out there and speak. Scrap. Struggle. Lose your jobs. Get new jobs. Lose those jobs, too.\n\nAnd then THEN, something will happen \u2013 something will click, and your tattoo\u2019ed asses will wind up rich and famous for creating this thing.\n\nAnd when you look back on it all, you\u2019ll have all those cool stories that come from building something great together. And you won\u2019t be kicking yourselves for the compromises you made early.\n\nI would give anything to be in a position to take the sorts of risks you guys can take right now. Trust me, in 10 years, your lives WILL look very different, one way or the other.\n\nWhatever happens with Brogan and Bojan and this social/fitness movement/experiment of theirs, they will look back on this as one of the most amazing times of their lives. And we can all have the privilege of saying we were there for it.\n\nMeanwhile, if any of you has an extra million bucks burning a hole in your pocket, maybe consider investing in these guys. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll ever see the money again, but you might find the return is a whole lot more valuable.\n", "title": "The Full Experience by Mike Howard of November Project", "url": "http://november-project.com/the-full-experience-by-mike-howard-of-november-project/", "workout_entry": true, "author": "brogan", "location": "POINT (-71.0635000000000048 42.3581000000000003)", "date": "2013-11-21", "dow": 3}, "model": "novproj.post", "pk": 81}, {"fields": {"body": "**EDMONTON NOTES**:  \n_by Nadim_\n\nIt\u2019s not even PR day, but we really wanted to hulk smash some records and make history. We must have been inspired by Monday\u2019s history lesson. We didn\u2019t just set a TR (Tribe record), but we set an NPR (November Project Record) today. We have a thing called Badges of Honour for those who brave the cold. We earned our -10 badge last week and today, we decided to skip the -20 badge, and go straight to -30. 45 people who scoffed at Old Man Winter and earned themselves the -30 Badge of Honour. Since we haven\u2019t found a way to transfer frozen paint onto shirts yet, you will have to wait to get them, but we know who you are, and we are damn proud of you.\n\nSince this tribe was a newborn baby on July 15th, we have been asked every week what we would do when it gets to -30C. Well, we finally walked the walk. -31C after windchill. For our American folks, -31C is the equivalent of -24F. For our California friends, windchill is when it is so cold, you get 3in icicles on your nose ([see today\u2019s Facebook album](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.244203972403095.1073741861.217978318358994&type=3)).\n\nHalf an hour after the workout, it was about 10 degrees warmer in Edmonton. I\u2019m not saying that we warmed the city, but it\u2019s a hell of a coincidence.\n\nWe are still collecting to #weatherproofYEG. There are people out there who do not have as many layers as you, and could use your help. Friday will be the last day that we will collect clothes. Bring em to the hill or to MEC.\n\nFriday, we [celebrate](http://november-project.com/weatherproofing-recruiting-and-the-watering-hole). MEC \u2013 7pm. The Pint DT \u2013 9pm.\n\nWe came, we hugged, we conquered.\n\n**DC NOTES**:  \n_By: Steve (Has a girlfriend), Danny (Doesn\u2019t), and Ivan (Canines goin crazy for that Brazilian bark)_\n\nGreetings North American tribes. South of the Mason Dixon Line was having a blast this morning. We had a first time visitor that enthusiastically wanted to write the blog post, so meet Ivan (pronounced ee-v\u00e0n, that\u2019s right female pups, he\u2019s a Brazilian Husky) you may remember him from our [We Missed You post](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=180208398836332&set=a.176926952497810.1073741830.175783912612114&type=3&theater) a few weeks ago.\n\nAfter being publicly shamed on Facebook for missing November Project two weeks ago(they used my puppy picture, I mean, come on, I\u2019m a solid 70 pounds now), I was determined to get myself and Emma to the steps. With great fortitude I arose this morning, took my morning pee on a fire hydrant (I think a golden retriever has been trying to claim it as hers, but I\u2019ll pee twice on it tomorrow to make sure it stays in my possession), and hopped in the car to head to the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nWhen I #JustShowedUp I couldn\u2019t believe what I saw. There were 65 people hopping up and down, chanting to one another and giving hugs. I couldn\u2019t contain myself; my tongue had a mind of its own. I licked all the newbies and gave them my own personal hug. After saying our good mornings and f&#$ Yeahs, we started running up and down the Lincoln stairs. Tail wagging, fur in the breeze, I was home. Each trip up the stairs I didn\u2019t know whether lick someone or give them a paw five, so I did a lot of both. Luckily I hadn\u2019t gelled my fur yet because people were going nuts petting me, I\u2019ll detag the awkward pics later. After we ran, everyone stood in a big dog bowl like shape and sat on one other. All I wanted to do was jump up and down on them but I did my own personal squats, #RippedGlutes #BootyMeat. I am excited to bark about this tonight with all my homies, they\u2019ll be jealous. To all the other canines in the District, 6:30 am at the Lincoln Memorial is the place to be. Just do not even think of peeing the northeast portion of the grass adjacent to the 3rd step, that is my territory, seriously, its mine. See you all next week!\n\n**MADISON NOTES**:  \n_by Teddy G_\n\nToday, under a glorious pink and orange sunrise, we introduced Flower Power(TM), a pedal-shaped jaunt that included everything from [hoisties](http://youtu.be/SRUAOePXU2s) to [eye contact squats](http://youtu.be/5LRgqFcfuWg). Between the sustained eyeball staring, the skyline, and copious hugs, it was as much a romantic, intimate 100 person date as it was a badass workout.\n\nAlso, 20 guys showed up with cases of Muscle Milk. To each his own, but for the record, DG and TG didn\u2019t touch the stuff. We keep it all natural.\n\n**SF NOTES**  \n_by Clayton_\n\nThat\u2019s right sports-fans, you don\u2019t have to bang Al Roker to know it was a soggy one out there this morning. But the tribe is strong, the tribe is #weatherproof, and frankly, the tribe doesn\u2019t really have it that bad \u2014 it was still like 60 degrees and there was barely any wind. If this is as bad as it gets, I think we\u2019re going to be fine. In the interest of avoiding a lawsuit, I\u2019d like to go on record and say that I don\u2019t have definitive proof that Al Roker withholds predictive weather-related information for sexual favors. It was a friend of a friend, and it was only that one time\u2026 (her name rhymes with Schmeredith Vierra). Incidentally, if we could refrain from using the words \u2018Al Roker\u2019 and \u2018soggy\u2019 in the same sentence ever again, that would be dandy. Thanks.\n\nDespite the less than ideal weather, NPSF showed up in some serious numbers this morning to take down some Tabatas. If you were like me and were sorely disappointed to find out that Tabatas weren\u2019t some sort of new and exciting Mexican breakfast dish, too bad. You instead got a healthy dose of burpees, v-ups, sergeant jumps, and a delicious side-order of planks. Oh, and don\u2019t forget the suicides. Yeah, you heard me right, SUICIDES! We broke it down like a 1990\u2019s gym class out there. I tried telling Laura that I was having some \u201cfemale issues,\u201d but she didn\u2019t buy it.\n\nTHIS FRIDAY, come join us for hills. 6:22 AM in the Kezar Stadium parking lot. Drop your verbal now, drop it like a hot Tabata.\n\n**SAN DIEGO NOTES**:  \n_by Jessie_\n\nGood Morning San Diego (and the rest of the world)!!\n\nYou know it\u2019s gonna be a good morning when the workout starts with Early 90s Hip Hop on the boom box (well, iPod speakers\u2026but lets just say it was a boom box, a big. boom. box.) We had our biggest group yet, 35 of you crazy mo\u2019fos and it couldn\u2019t have been more fun! We had people chasing dogs, baby sebastians on hills, toddlers tagging park benches\u2026it was pure, incredible, insanity! Lessons learned at NP-SD this morning: 1. Running UP Kate Sessions hill first, is way harder during intervals (and because we love yo fine asses \u2013 that\u2019s probably the only way it will ever be done again!) 2. San Diego still has some issue with forming straight lines and circles (I blame it on us just being so laid back) 3. LP rocks galaxy pants like pro and finally 4. McLovin is the fastest man alive. A big shout out the New Balance crew and all our newbies for helping make today one of the best Hump day workouts ever \u2013 it\u2019s incredible to see this tribe grow, I\u2019m definitely gonna need some new sunglasses with all this NEON!\n\nYa Feeling Good San Diego? Fuck Yeah!\n\nCan\u2019t wait to see everyone tonight at Recruiting Papers!\n\n**DENVER NOTES**:  \n_by Dan_\n\nKings of the Castle. Today the Denver tribe protected our castle and grew stronger for future bouts with Mother Nature, alarm clocks, and cocoon syndrome (wtf??). With the Civic Center Amphitheater as our coliseum, the valiant tribe persevered through stair climb sprints, with interruptions by the glorious chime of More Cowbell. This chime marked a break in the sprint routine and welcomed intervals of burpees, pushups, and anything else that Aaron felt like doing.\n\nThe tribe was audited today by Megan, a professional performance measurement analyst and Boston tribe regular. Megan endured our workout and dutifully evaluated us from her checklist of NP Norms. In an effort to get extra credit, we awkwardly sang happy birthday to her. Look for her at a future NP workout adding to her NP Passport, in which she hopes to earn tags from every tribe.\n\nAs we paint more grass roots gear, pass out our Recruiting Papers, and laugh at each other\u2019s \u2018fierce\u2019 mug shots, the tribe continues to beautify our community.\n\n**BOSTON NOTES**:  \n_by Bojan_\n\nRemember that time 600 people showed up to work out in 25 degree weather? 25 degrees is not Edmonton cold, but it\u2019s still pretty chilly.\n\nLet\u2019s get something straight. BG and I are about to tackle our 3rd Boston winter as a part of this crazy movement, and one thing that we notice is that as weatherproof we are, our numbers seem to suffer a little bit when the temps hit below freezing. We understand that on a dark, cold, mornings instead of working out, all you want to do enjoy the warmth and fuzziness of your bed sheets. But not this morning! You, the tribe came out strong\u2026 So strong that we thought it was August! You know there were a lot of people there when it took me solid 10 minutes just to start everyone. Keep it going friends, I promise you\u2019ll have a blast this winter and you\u2019ll accidentally get fit.\n\nYou probably heard about our #FREE racing event called [#SceneBeSeen](http://november-project.com/scene-be-seen/) that sold out 400 racing spots within 90 minutes of the link going live. If you weren\u2019t able to get the racing bib, we apologize. We didn\u2019t anticipate that the response will be this positive and overwhelming. Many of you asked if you can just come and run the race without the bib. Let\u2019s put it this way \u2013 the race is at the public space, and if you just happen to run around the Pleasure Bay at 6:30pm in neon/illuminated costumes, who are we to prevent you from doing it. If that still seems uncomfortable, please consider this [Boston Brunch Runners event](https://www.facebook.com/events/727355063946082/?ref_dashboard_filter=upcoming) taking place at the same time, same place, with same people (they just happen to love pancakes and lobster bibs).

There was so much energy from the crowd and such joy in the runners that I just thought, hey. It might be fun to run something some time. This fleeting thought solidified in my mind after the tragic bombing that took place at the finish line. Call me sappy, but I thought running something would be a nice, personal tribute to the victims. So I started training\u2026 Kind of.**\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s make one thing clear: I\u2019m not really a runner. Finding motivation was hard; especially since running alone on a treadmill was just flat-out boring. I was pretty close to just stopping. Nobody knew of my plan to run a race, so no one could be disappointed if I didn\u2019t follow through with it.\r\n\r\nI first started hearing about November Project from some of the other girls in my graduate program back around February. They always chatted it up as this great, fun experience. I thought it would be fun to check it out; but I also thought they were a bit crazy. Who in their right mind would get up at 6 in the morning to exercise? The excuses were just too easy: I was too busy, it was too early, and I couldn\u2019t make it to the workout locations. Plus, everyone there was probably in great shape, and I couldn\u2019t run 30 seconds on a treadmill without getting winded. So I hesitated for a few weeks, okay, months, before I finally decided to try it.\r\n\r\nOne of my friends (Katie Fithian) offered to meet me at good-old Summit Ave on Friday mornings, so I hopped on the green line and made my way there for the first time over the Summer. I don\u2019t really know what I was expecting; but I wasn\u2019t disappointed. I learned very quickly that one can\u2019t go to November Project without expecting to meet a handful of new people each day. And if you are a germaphobe, November Project is not for you, as you will be hugged or high-fived by more people than you can count.\r\n\r\nThen came the hard part: Actually running. I had never run with another person before. I remember my friend asking me before our first run together, \u201cOkay. How do I do this?\u201d My genius reply? \u201cUmmm. I don\u2019t know. I guess if I just take your arm we can just see what happens?\u201d So we started jogging slowly, very slowly, up that mountain of a road. \r\n", "title": "Ashley Brow of November Project", "url": "http://november-project.com/ashley-brow-of-november-project/", "workout_entry": true, "author": "brogan", "location": "POINT (-71.0987734794616699 42.3648146515396391)", "date": "2013-11-18", "dow": 0}, "model": "novproj.post", "pk": 83}, {"fields": {"body": "Due to significant amount of rainfall that covered our faces, bodies and shoes during this morning\u2019s run to the #BallerNovember location in Cambridge we decided to keep the workout time minimal, noise level high and obnoxious, and our cameras dry in the safety of our homes.

I worked hard, going 4-6 times a week. I pushed myself and learned to like pushing my limits. I taught myself to run as I had never run before. I slowly increased my running time starting at 5 minutes on a treadmill and within months I was running for over an hour outside. I lost weight, gained muscle, started to feel better about how I looked. \n\nFinally my after a year and a half, my workouts stagnated; I could tell I was not pushing myself hard enough. Even worse, I was getting bored. I had tried to bring people to the gym with me, but they rarely lasted for long as workout partners. I was losing momentum and motivation. It was at this time that my friend Anna Israel noticed all the hard work I had been doing and asked me to join her for a workout with November Project at the Harvard Stadium. So, on August 15th, 2012, I showed up, a little nervous, but excited to see what it was about. When I started out I ran the first, second, and third sections thinking this was going to be a piece of cake, then the fourth section hit me like a brick wall. I slowed down and started walking sections. It was one of the toughest workouts I had ever done, but I finished a half tour. What got me through it was the energy and encouragement of the group. I loved seeing the excitement of Brogan and Bojan pushing people to their limits and how everyone truly just wanted to help you improve. November Project was exactly what I had been looking for at this time; a community to help push myself in my workouts and people who are excited to push to their limits.\n\nI got a lot more in the process than I ever expected. First I started feeling energized throughout my day; the positive energy from the tribe helped me go through my workday with a great big smile. Secondly, my wardrobe changed. I saw the pictures posted and all my black workout clothes made it hard to find myself. As someone who wore black for most of my life, it was strange to be seeking crazy bright colors for my workout clothes. Since then I was described as, \u201cElin, who always wears orange\u201d in a blog, my non-NP friends laughed at the suggestion. Now color has even made it to my everyday wardrobe. Finally, with all friends I have made at November Project, my commitment to being at the workouts is solid as I want to see my friends and know that no matter how hard the workout is at the end I will be happy to have done it.\n\nWhile I am committed to the workouts I am neither the fittest nor the fastest member. However I am committed and seek to push myself to improve. Many of you will join November Project and probably pass me. However for those who worry about being slow or not being fit enough, you can bet you will have company as November Project has people of all fitness levels and ages and you will find someone your speed that you can get to know and help push each other to get better.\n\nFor those who might be questioning working out year round with November Project, I did it last year and I can say that if you come to every workout, your body adjusts and you learn what works for you. Some of the worst weather days were the most fun and memorable workouts, so when you see rain, snow or other extreme weather forecasted, don\u2019t hesitate to show up. Some of my best memories include doing seven minutes of Burpees at the [#DestinationDeck](http://november-project.com/destination-deck/) during Hurricane Sandy (aka, [#HurricaneDeck](http://november-project.com/when-life-gives-you-sandy-you-do-a-sebastian/)), doing sprints in a foot of fresh snow on the track next to the Harvard Stadium, and running up Summit Ave during blizzards. Each of these were tough, but awesome workouts that brought out the best in our community as you got to know who was willing to be there no matter what. \n\nI am extremely thankful for Brogan and Bojan\u2019s work to build November Project, but it is the energy each of you bring to the workout that makes it truly great. I sincerely believe that if there is a November Project near you (Boston, Wisconsin, Edmonton, San Francisco, San Diego, DC, and Denver) you need to get your ass out of bed and check them out. I promise you that if you give it a chance it will change your life for the better and in ways that you may not expect. If you come to Boston, introduce yourself to me, I love meeting new tribe members.  \n**Just. Show.

The ante was upped today with running farther, jumping higher, practicing for plank challenges, and an accidental excess of baby Sebastians\u2026and we loved it! In preparation for The Final Hump, NPSD has initiated a Midget Hump to cap off all workouts and get y\u2019all super speedy and ready to tackle then end of month..times to be posted! Keep spreadin the love SD, it\u2019s great to see this tribe grow\u2026so many hugs!!!!!\n\n**EDMONTON NOTES**:  \n_by Nadim_\n\n**November Rain**. First off, Axl and Slash did not show up today.\n\nYou know that feeling, when you walk out the door in winter, and it\u2019s warm? Well, for the few who showed up today, you now know what it feels like. A coyote was spotted trying to join the tribe this morning. He was a bit late and didn\u2019t want to give any hugs for some reason so he ran off. Crazy Dave (not to be confused with Camper Dave) wore his swimsuit. You\u2019d think he was still on his vacation in Arizona, but he actually thought we were going for a swim in the river this morning. I\u2019m not sure how you confuse stairs with swimming. While we all experienced a tropical paradise up in Edmonton today, we sent some cold weather to a few of our tribes down south.\n\nWe then did our best tree impression (except for Crazy Dave, who just wanted to lie in snow) as a reminder to decorate for the winter season. It was actually because I just bought some decorations and needed to know what the tree was.\n\n**DENVER NOTES**:  \n_by Dan_\n\nToday Denver is stronger. We had our largest tribe to date, we tagged shirts with our coveted NP 5280 tag, and we worked our uppers and lowers like no other. After a brisk warmup and a few \u2018fuck yeahs\u2019 (there were no children present, so Dan allowed swearing), we partnered up for a 100 push-up & 100 leg-toss challenge. There were some groans, and moans, but this tribe is primed for a dose of \u2018Sebastians\u2019 in the next few weeks. Next we hit the Civic Center Park Amphitheater seats and crushed out 15-minutes of Pinwheels (diagram to follow). \n\nSweat, Smiles, and Strength are what we are about. Tell your friends, tell your co-workers, tell your mailman: #JustShowUp. Come join us next Wednesday at 6:15A. \n\n**SAN FRANCISCO NOTES**:  \n_by Laura_\n\nIf I creepy man with a headband covering his face approaches you during morning announcements, don\u2019t fret. It\u2019s a Turkish Bostonian surprise visiting your tribe. And it will surely make your morning. After *finally* dishing out the positivity award to our miniature bundle of sunshine love, Lillian, we got down and muddy with a remix of The Huffman, which I like to call the Dirty Mustache Ride. Doesn\u2019t really make sense. Somewhat inappropriate. But nonsense and sexual innuendos are the cornerstones of NPSF.\n\nHighlights: Clayton busted his ass and bled all over the park. In a funny way. Rebecca and Natalie, once again, killed the yearbook photographs and they will be coming sometime this week. RECRUITING PAPERS SATURDAY!\n\n**DC NOTES**:  \n_by Steve (have you seen his abs?) and Danny (put a shirt on)_\n\nProven: Direct correlation with drop in temperature and amount of badasses that show up to the Lincoln Memorial. Momma Nature brought hexagonal hydrogen bonds to Honest Abe but DCA was rockin\u2019 this morning with one of our best hug sessions yet. We started out acapella with birthday love to Anna (Gtown Triathlon stud) and Donna (flat out awesome). The workout, we are titling \u201cThe Mcenroe,\u201d (because this dude would show up to NP and drop more f bombs than Danny) consists of 9 tennis balls varying in f$#@ yeahs, burpies, squats, and pushups. While running stairs the balls are passed off between tribe members who introduce themselves with a hug and cheer the new ball owner on as they now do what is written on the ball. The result? Smiles, laughs, sweat, and a whole lotta hugs. After The Mcenroe workout, we did a relay race mixed with a plank hold that had the attention of Park Police (hope they know what\u2019s comin\u2019).\n\nClass was in session at the end as we gave out our first homework assignment: make your community a better place in anyway, shape, or form. Due date: 12/1. We\u2019re excited to grow commUNITy and to see all these faces next week #VerbalNOW. Nama-fucking-stay. DCA OUT. \n\n**MADISON NOTES**:  \n_by Ted_\n\nWe experienced Edmonton summer weather this morning (around 10F) so of course, attendance dropped, right? Oh, but you\u2019re so very wrong! On the contrary, we were just shy of 70 crazy tribespeople. Who ARE these people, you ask? Great question \u2013 we wanted to know, too, so today\u2019s workout was, at its core, about everyone learning as many names as possible. It was a rousing success \u2013 no more awkward head nods and generalized \u201cwhat\u2019s up, man\u201ds/ \u201chey ladies\u201d. Watch out NP MSN, once we know your name, there\u2019s no hiding. \n\n**BOSTON NOTES**:  \n_by Bojan_\n\nWe didn\u2019t have the group photo but we did take literally one million mugshots. Giant thanks to Dooster boys for all their help. Mugshots coming soon to a facebook page near you. \n\nSave the date \u2013 Sunday, November 24th, 6pm \u2013 11pm. Think running, beers, and costumes.

I have always been a morning person and I\u2019ve owned a gym membership since high school and/or worked out with Tony Horton or Shawn T at home. \uf04a I\u2019ve run a few half marathons, road races and fun runs but never with any real training. I took kick boxing classes, step and power at the gym and I\u2019ve always loved working out in groups but gyms get stale, people lose commitment and workouts get boring. This does not happen with NP. I inquired about the photos and checked out NP\u2019s webpage then decided I would check it out that Friday, December 14th. My watch alarm went off at 5:15 am, Friday would be my first of many AMAZING workouts with the tribe.\n\nOne of the things I loved best about that Friday (besides the awesome hug from Brogan \uf04a ) was the diversity of the group. There were ALL SORTS of people, body types, athletic abilities, ethnicities, young people, and older people. It was fantastic!! Everyone was working hard and getting it done. There was no judgment, nobody was saying how slow other people were or bragging about how quickly they were able to get the work out in. Instead there was cheering, high fives and hugs being exchanged. \n\nSomething that has always inspired me is watching people give their all. When people continue to do something even though it\u2019s difficult for them and in the end are ultimately successful can be so rewarding! Our bodies are amazing and we truly don\u2019t know what we\u2019re capable of until we push ourselves. On our own it is very difficult, for most people, to push beyond their comfort zone. It is easier to give up when things start getting hard if no one is there to boost you up and cheer you on. At November Project there is so much support and people genuinely want to see you be successful, improve AND have fun. \n\nOn days I do November Project I am more productive, I stay positive throughout the day, I have more energy, I\u2019m naturally high for the next 14 hours. In March I found out I was pregnant and I was curious to what extent I\u2019d be able to keep up with November Project. My doctor said to listen to my body, keep hydrated and make sure that I\u2019m breathing throughout my exercises. On April 3rd I accomplished running 100 sections at Harvard and completed it again May 8th. I continued my workouts as usual paying close attention to breathing and drinking water. In May I had to leave NH to go to my other family and community Camp Hawkeye. It was tough to leave but great to be able to stay in contact through the blog , random homework assignments and different challenges throughout the summer! I had to return to Boston for monthly check ups and made sure that they fell on a Wednesday. \n\nReturning officially to NP in October, 33 weeks pregnant, gave me new energy and excitement. #deckaday challenge really motivated me to keep my body strong. Along with Wed and Fri workouts I have been feeling FANTASTIC! At 38 weeks pregnant now I feel outstanding. I have more energy, no lower back pain, I\u2019ve kept a healthy weight, the baby is doing phenomenal and I expect to have an easier faster deliver. \n\nNovember Projects workout and community have made a huge difference in my life. I am inspired every workout by the amazing people who are there and I feel the best physically that I\u2019ve ever felt. The best decision you can make it to show up. When I find out your name you\u2019ll know who I am because I will be cheering you on and making sure you\u2019re having an excellent work out! THANKS BROGAN AND BOJAN for what you\u2019ve created and thanks to everyone who shows up and inspires me to do better and be better.

Even though I know him very little, I love this man. The tribe is former D1. The tribe is swimming. \r\n\r\nFor the past month I have been working on a little article about what it is like being a freshly retired NCAA athlete and how the 20 or so year career suddenly comes to an end. I try and detail what internal struggles that this \u201cretirement\u201d brings and the feeling of being lost that comes along with leaving your sport. For me, November Project was something to help cover up that void. I love November Project very much and it is truly the highlight of my week. I hope this article conveys that feeling while also trying to identify what it means to a lot of people. I was hoping you could throw it up on the website and Facebook and see if other people identify with it to a degree. I know DG has often said that you all don\u2019t truly know what you all are doing by gathering us together and getting in a good workout, but clearly something special is happening. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have the following that you do. I can speak for all of Madison when I say TG and DG have brought something special to the city and I know that Brogan started that out in Boston. I hope you enjoy this article. Let me know what you think. \r\n\r\n**Being an NCAA athlete in a non-major sport is an interesting journey. Competing at the Division I level is the pinnacle of your career outside of making the Olympics or World Championships. While most major sport athletes, i.e. football and basketball, have the hope and dream to perform professionally, non-major sport athletes; track, rowing, softball, swimming, etc.; have already reached the last leg of their journey. After graduation, the pursuit of perfection that, while in the sport feels lifelong, suddenly and abruptly ends for non-major athletes. **\r\n\r\nDespite this looming end, the four or five years these athletes get to participate in and be a part of the empowering spirit of collegiate athletics are remarkable. I was a swimmer for the University of Wisconsin and my entire existence centered on moving forward in my sport and becoming better for the team. There is something special about being a part of a team in which every member has the same passion, the same drive. In high school the vast majority of athletes only go through the motions. This majority will only put in enough effort to get by, move with enough meaning so they do not come in last, and chastise the minority that dreams of being stronger, faster, and better than anyone that came before them. However, in intercollegiate athletics, these big dreamers are surrounded by athletes with the same determination and immerse themselves in the overwhelming competitive spirit that is so appealing to us crazy souls. You are no longer an individual, but part of a collective One, with every part of that One working towards a common goal.\r\n\r\nThe first steps taken after my intimate involvement with the swim team brought an immediate sense of just one. In a single moment your membership to the club of elite athletes is terminated and you are left adrift. While your former teammates are still your friends and respect the journey you made, you are now apart from their journey and they plan on becoming better than you ever were. These haunting realities take many retired athletes who never return from it, and never continue their journey towards a healthy lifestyle. No amount of, \u201cYou did something amazing with your career!\u201d or, \u201cThink of all the great memories you have,\u201d can heal the open wound that was left when your sport was ripped away from you. You know you could have gone farther in your athletics but you just ran out of time. \r\n\r\nThese unanswered questions haunt many of these retired athletes. I became very caught up in wondering what I could have done in my sport if I made different decisions, if I had chosen a different path at critical moments in my career, or if I had just one more year. In the first months after my athletic career ended, I focused on school. Once school ended my first post undergrad job filled my time; however, once I got settled in I found myself drifting through the young twenties lifestyle. Life was full of late nights and even later mornings. I only have a job in the service industry keeping me anchored, and a very superficial anchor at that. The pinnacle of the service industry is becoming a general manager or maybe one day opening your own restaurant, both of which have never been dreams of mine. My bartending job is just a position I hold until I find out what I really want to do with my life and I quickly discovered I was not on any meaningful path. I pursued my athletic career as far as I could and this was supposed to be a tool that would leave me with some sense of direction for finding a career and progressing into adulthood, but I was never given a map. I wasn\u2019t even left on the side of the road but rather in the middle of the desert. There were no signs to point me in the direction of how to stay healthy and move forward into adulthood with a healthy mind and body. \r\n\r\nThese uncertainties are not exclusive to me, and everyone answers these questions differently when they are staring them in the face. Most of us are just looking for something to fill the void our sport left. After swimming, many immediately hurl themselves into two different activities: triathlons; which are way too expensive for recent college grads, or Competitive Masters Swimming which I have heard someone classify as a \u201cnever ending pit of ex-swimmers still pursuing their sad little dream after their time.\u201d For myself, I wanted nothing to do with hopping in the water and paddling around \u201dwith the masters\u201d. My only form of exercise for 21 years was going back and forth whilst gazing at that black line on the bottom of the pool and I needed a change. \r\n\r\nRunning became the substitute. Shoes are cheaper than a bike and riding equipment, so that threw out triathlons, and the appeal of being able to run absolutely anywhere at any time, and without paying for some elite gym membership was very convenient. My time on the road and trails became my private time: a time when I could push myself like I did when I was swimming and find that place beyond comfortable where I discover the physical limit of exhaustion I am capable of reaching. While this is freeing and a special time to look deep down within yourself, it can be lonely. The lack of a body next to you reaching for the same carrot, pushing closer and closer to a goal alone, and receiving no outside words of encouragement brings an emptying feeling. Then I heard about the November Project.\r\n\r\nAt first I was very reluctant to attend November Project. Meeting at 6:27 on Wednesday and Friday morning was a bit too early for my new nocturnal lifestyle. This was even tougher considering Wednesday was my day off, so that meant Tuesday was the night to stay out later and find a little extra trouble to get into. A dear friend of mine constantly pestered me to go. As one of the earliest attendees, joining a mere month after the Madison chapter kick started, she weathered the cold and used this new community to motivate herself every day. Every week she asked me to go. Every week she told me of the wonderful connection within this community she found. Every week I told her no. Finally after months of recruitment I just went. The first step is always the hardest and setting the alarm for an hour actually in the AM took a lot of will power. Six o\u2019clock came quick and simply getting up and moving was a challenge. Joints cracked and muscles ached as I slowly dawdled across the room to my alarm clock but I reached it, shut off the incessant beeping, and made my way into the foreign twilight of morning.\r\n\r\nI remember my first workout as being relatively easy. It was in early days of summer so the sun rose quickly and early. When I first arrived there was a slight chill in the air but once the body started moving the sweat poured. Our fearless and oddly enthusiastic leader Dan Graham, or DG as we all know and love him, greeted us with his booming voice and the newbie introductions began. For those who have attended a November Project-Madison workout before, you know the drill. We all form a circle and if you are new, one by one, you step to the middle and proudly say your name. In response you receive a resounding, \u201cHi, whatever your name is!\u201c You are instantly accepted into this club; however, on that first morning I was not so sure I wanted to be accepted quite yet. \r\n\r\nNot to my surprise I handled the workout with ease and finished feeling very confident about my physical health. However, the closing statements by DG surprised me, but I did not realize how much at the time. He thanked the group, and then me personally, for just getting up and coming. DG singled me out and made sure I knew how much my attendance meant to him and did the same for all the other newbies in attendance. After his speech and a few awkward, sweaty hugs that were apparently mandatory, I left and went back to the shelter of my sheets. This was the routine for a couple weeks. Wake up, work out, feel good about myself, but quickly return to my late night lifestyle that was the norm. I ignored most of the encouraging statements and just grinded forward into the workouts. Running Bascom Hill is difficult when the flat roads of Madison are where you build your weekly miles, but my fitness level proved a formidable match for the workout. I was often at the front and while people would pass me, they often faded back into a place I did not care for or even knew existed. I was there solely for myself.\r\n\r\nAfter a very short period of time, the encouraging comments, high fives, and sweaty hugs become something you cannot quite ignore during those morning workouts. I found myself no longer groaning at the alarm, but instead quickly made my way to the top of Bascom Hill in the center of UW campus, standing in the shadow of Abraham Lincoln not waiting for the workout, but waiting to see the others I had joined. The early morning hellos and how you doings began to feel good. I began to welcome the comments from DG and the others about how great it was to have me there and I returned them whole-heartedly. I was no longer greeting everyone with the fake, \u201cIt is so good to see you!\u201d I had actually started to mean it. When I received words of encouragement during the workout, I no longer rolled my eyes but shouted back and told them how awesome they were. It was a strange realization that this group had become something that I cared deeply about. I was not shocked at my acceptance, the November Project happily accepts everyone that makes the effort to get up early to come work out with them. It was the acceptance of them that grew within me internally that struck me as strange. I started caring about my fellow November Project attendees that at first were just there as I ran. Now I was running with them, struggling with them, sweating with them, and laughing with them. While I use to get up just to work out, I now was getting up for everyone else. I absolutely had to get up so I could encourage these insane people and move forward with them. Not all of us were moving towards anything in particular or training for a specific race, but we were all pursuing a better self. The abandonment I had felt from the end of my swimming career was gone. I had found a group of people that enjoyed diving into the challenge of becoming better. No longer was it about the workout, but rather it was about just moving forward.\r\n\r\nThat is what November Project means to me: moving forward. I am still just a bartender in the often short-lived service industry, but now I have something to move me forward, something to better myself, and a group of people that are moving forward with me. Where it is leading me I am still trying to figure out, and as it turns out, November Project itself is still trying to figure out what exactly that destination is or how exactly we are getting there. Where is this movement taking us? What are we making by coming together two times a week and just simply working out? These questions remain unanswered, but we are searching. The question as to why we do this is simple. It is a connection between like-minded, semi-insane individuals that enjoy pushing themselves to their absolute limits, then taking another step. It is doing something that makes you uncomfortable so that you better yourself inside and out. It is something that is experienced when you simply get up and move forward. \r\n", "title": "Standing Up After Sitting Still by NP MSN\u2019s Jeffrey Morris", "url": "http://november-project.com/standing-up-after-sitting-still-by-np-msns/", "workout_entry": false, "author": "brogan", "location": "POINT (-71.1027430000000038 42.3284260000000003)", "date": "2013-11-11", "dow": 0}, "model": "novproj.post", "pk": 90}, {"fields": {"body": "Every Monday during our birthday month will be celebrated on basketball courts around Boston area.

We love this guy. Ladies and gents\u2026. I give you\u2026 Deniz!**\n\nFree Fitness for Everybody\n\nFirst of all, I would like to thank November Project tribe for making me live the best year of my life. On October 31st 2012, I stepped into Harvard stadium not knowing what I was getting myself into. I was just trying to have fewer fluctuations in my weight, be less bored when I was running, and enjoy the socializing while doing something good for myself. Today after exactly a year, working out has become a regular part of my life. I have made so many friends with similar lifestyles. I accidentally got into signing up for races too, and have now discovered something great about running. As Joan Benoit Samuelson put it: \u201cDoing something for yourself like running, and using it to test yourself, will only make you feel better about your career or your family role.\u201d  \nI want to talk about the top 4 myths about November Project. If you ever considered joining November Project but had cold feet or you already showed up but are worried about the colder and darker mornings, this blog is intended for you. \n\n**Myth# 1**: I am not fit enough for November Project  \nWell, that\u2019s exactly what I thought a year ago too. When you see pictures of us on Facebook, Twitter or other media, we all look awesome, really ripped, and it looks like we kick ass all the time. Yes, we want to look good, we want to be proud of our accomplishments. Some of us (like me) want the whole world to know how hard we work out and we proudly display our cool pictures on Facebook. Here are a few facts you should know about these pictures:\n\n* Some of these pictures are taken when we are fresh at the beginning of the workout.  \n* Our photographer friends usually catch us from a good angle, and they take multiple pictures to make sure we look good in the one that will be posted.  \n* If we are still not satisfied with the result, we can hide the picture.\n\nSo you get the point. You only see the cream of the crop. Here are a few examples of how we really look when we are working hard. These pictures are real. They aren\u2019t staged or posed. You know how the saying goes: If you look great during a workout, you likely aren\u2019t working hard enough. We are not always good looking. Sometimes, we smile and we still don\u2019t look great.\n\nIt is true there are really fit and athletic people among us who inspire us, and yes we are proud of the incredible athletic achievements of the group. But, the majority of us come from all levels of fitness from the pretty fit ones to those who are trying to get off the couch and start working on their fitness.\uf04a We support each other regardless of our backgrounds or level of fitness. We come to November Project to get fit, to cheer each other on, and push each other to our individual limits. We are just regular people trying to stay fit, and we are having fun doing it.\n\n**Myth #2**: I will be the slowest person out there.\n\nNobody is actually counting how many sections or hills you run, how fast you finish or how many push-ups you can do. We do want to push ourselves to the limit, encourage our fellow tribe members to do the same, and sometimes race with our peers, but the real race is against ourselves. \n\n**Myth #3**: November Project members are morning people, I am not\n\nNobody likes to get out of a warm bed while it is dark and cold out there. Nobody likes to function on not enough hours of sleep. But you have to make a choice. Most of our day jobs require us to sit at a desk all day, and those New Year resolutions do not last very long. Often we miss workouts when something comes up during our lunch break or we have plans for dinner. I am not saying that people who work out later in the day will always fail, but I know for many of us, getting it done the first thing in the morning works the best. It does not get easier. Every November Project morning, I consider snoozing the alarm and going back to bed when I first wake up, but once I show up and complete the workout, I feel like a champion. And the best thing is I know there will be friends who will cheer for me, and that I will miss out on fun if I don\u2019t show up. That\u2019s the whole charm and philosophy of November Project. So the next time you have problem waking up and showing up to November Project, remember how awesome you will feel earning that chocolate-raspberry croissant after the workout. Your other options are either having to miss out on that croissant because you did not earn it, or eating those croissants without earning, and you know what happens then\u2026\n\n**Myth #4**: They are weather-proof, I am not.  \nWe are made of the same material right? Water freezes at 32 \u00b0F or 0 \u00b0C, and our bodies are mostly made of water. So we do get cold. Yes, some of us have higher or lower tolerance. But believe me, if you put a few layers on and work hard while you are out there, you will survive and you will eventually get used to it. Yes there is that other indoor option, but it is just not as fun, and it costs money.  \nFree Fitness for Everyone!

The cover story for the December issue of Runner\u2019s World is nearly 100% November Project and 400% real! It\u2019s been spotted now in the hands of November Project members in all seven locations and, as of yesterday, at least one airport bookstore near you. As much as this RW tale highlights the Boston experience it\u2019s important to know that we, as a seven-city mob, are growing fast in all the right ways. Getting this type of recap of who we are and what we stand for is huge\u2026 giant\u2026 no, its\u2026 its\u2026 it\u2019s unlike anything we\u2019ve seen in our 2 year lifespan.

Open wide and make room for this power-hype burrito of WEDNESDAY love-sauce coming your way! **The tribe is seemingly taking over**. \n\n**DC NOTES**: \n\nDC tribe is strong. Our founding month started off awesome with everyone recruiting hard. We\u2019re growing so much in DC that we are now friends with our friendly neighborhood National Park Police Officer, Will. We also had our newest \u201c[We Missed You](http://november-project.com/category/we-missed-you/)\u201d candidate ([see our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/NovemberProjectDC)). Today\u2019s workout consisted of some spice adopted from the mother tribe: [The Fire Drill](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV4WmJO17FM). We formed groups of three and ran 35 minutes of Lincoln\u2019s steps. For every fire drill we had to meet up with our group and do 5 push-ups and five burpees. We\u2019re building community and giving DC great asses. It was tough, we had sweaty hugs after, we went home. Fuck Yeah.\n\n**WISCONSIN NOTES**: \n\nAxel Rose talked about the cold November rain, but this morning NP MSN soaked it up like champs. The highlight had to be our impromptu game of tag in a very, very tiny space. The fact that no one was seriously injured is a testament to our tribe\u2019s cat-like reflexes and agility. Also notable: DG slept in for the first time in decades. As depicted above, one missed workout was enough for Dan to be forgotten and replaced \u2013 an NTD (New Tall Dan) made his first NP appearance today and was ultimately bowed down to as DG\u2019s successor. Needless to say, if both TDs show up on Friday, shiz will get REAL.\n\nAlso, we had over 120 people at our \u201cOpen House\u201d on Friday. This was by far our largest turnout in NP MSN history. It was historic. This whole \u201cRunner\u2019s World\u201d article, if that\u2019s their real name, won\u2019t hurt too much for recruiting. \n\n**EDMONTON NOTES**: \n\nWe tested out a new camera today, and it turns out, most of you are ghosts. I thought Halloween was last week! What am I talking about? When I post the photos this evening, it will all make sense\u2026 or will it?\n\nBrian came out 50 minutes early this morning and was going to chip the ice off the stairs. His attempts at recruiting help failed miserably. In fact, he didn\u2019t even clean a single step! NP\u2019s magical fairy godmother came and cleaned it for us. I\u2019m 40% sure that the city employee that cleaned the stairs looks nothing like a fairy godmother, but 99% sure that that employee is pretty f\u2019n magical. What\u2019s more magical is seeing 4 newbies out on one of the coldest days we have ever had!\n\nLet\u2019s be honest though, we got it easy. San Diego has the harshest climate to deal with, so our thoughts are with you as you head into this winter. We are still collecting items to #weatherproof Edmonton until November 22nd, which will end with us celebrating the November Project\u2019s 2nd Birthday at MEC and the Pint Downtown! More details to come. \n\n**DENVER NOTES**:\n\nThe Denver tribe payed homage to their Boston roots by running Shamrocks in the Civic Center Amphitheater this morning at 6:15AM. We ran clovers up and down the seats and mixed in burpees after each loop. We finally saw the smiling faces of each other this morning, thanks to the natural wonder of daylight savings time. The Denver tribe is now sporting freshly sprayed 5280 #grassroots gear. Finally, we sat down to read the December issue of Runner\u2019s World magazine cover to cover. Really we just looked at the pictures of ridiculously good looking and fit people\u2026 all images were photo-shopped, I\u2019m sure. The tribe is ready for global takeover. ~Bert\n\n**SAN DIEGO NOTES**:\n\n  \n\n\nThe SD tribe showed up ready to party rock this morning, and if the light of the sun wasn\u2019t enough to wake us up \u2013 feline themed, bedazzled pants, neon #GrassrootsGear, and half naked men sure did the trick! (Yes, we can still do that here is sunny San Diego #livinginparadise). Amidst the leg blasting workout we introduced a West Coast SPICE of \u201cBaby Sebastians\u201d\u2026just keep your ears peeled for that bullhorn and be ready to BS Flashmob style! Still confused? Just fucking show up and find out! We finished off our morning with \u201chip opening abs\u201d and tagged some newbie #GrassrootsGear. Then, like little kids on Christmas, we opened our box of Runner\u2019s World and tried not to pee with excitement! \n\n**SF NOTES** by Dan Clayton (Laura\u2019s Co-Leader):\n\n  \n\n\nGrizzly bear attacks, flat tires, spilled coffee, BART delays, cougar attacks, the 2pm meeting you forgot to prepare for, Africanized bees, WBZY\u2019s George Michael power hour, air jaws, going in for a hug when your blind date goes in for a handshake, and Hugh Grant. These are just a few of the things I\u2019m fully confident November Project San Francisco members can handle after CRUSHING the Smurf 2.0 workout this morning. I\u2019m also now realizing that I must have fallen asleep watching Animal Planet again last night, because like four of those things are terrifying animals. Seriously though, have you seen their special on when Hugh Grant attacks? It\u2019s haunting\u2026 and beautiful, and oddly I think narrated by himself\u2026 Anyways\u2026\n\nWith a little extra sun at our backs, we took Alamo Square by storm and got down and dirty with a whole mess of bad-assery. Throw in a couple n00bs and a FRONT PAGE ARTICLE and you\u2019ve got the recipe for a solid day. When you mix that much cardio and strength together into one workout, it\u2019s almost as lethal as the brown recluse spider. Am I right!? One guy made a comment about how NPSF members seem to be getting taller and skinnier \u2014 he was looking right at me, not sure how I feel about it yet. Somehow our fearless leader Fila managed to get 80 copies of this month\u2019s Runners World to the park, but nothing that girl ever does surprises me. I saw her pop and lock in a penguin costume one time, true story. Actually we all saw that, it was last week, at November Project. We have our second hill workout this Friday. DON\u2019T MISS IT! 6:20am at the bottom of Lyon Street steps. Clayton out. \n\n**BOSTON NOTES**:\n\nThough many folks from the \u201cnormal media\u201d have come and gone, staying just long enough to drop the right lingo and understand our workouts, this is not the case with Runner\u2019s World. [Caleb Daniloff](http://www.runnersworld.com/runners-stories/sobriety-test), the writer for the December issue cover story, will not be put in this classification.

The high from my achievement was long gone, along with my motivation, and the frigid holiday season had added pounds, as they always do. It\u2019s so easy to put exercise on the back burner when you have a family to tend to and homework piling up. I was in a plumped slump. A friend of mine had been harping on me for months about joining some workout group he was with that \u201cran stairs\u201d\u2026.I live on the 3rd floor, the last thing I wanted to do is RUN up stairs. Reluctantly, I looked up November Project on Facebook and coerced a friend join me at the next Monday workout, which didn\u2019t involve stairs. It was oddly warm that day. We ran a few miles to the workout and as we stepped onto the soggy grass at Titus Sparrow Park, we were greeted by about 60 other people that I\u2019d soon be calling friends. Thirty mins and a deck later, I was sold. I could never have imagined doing sit-ups in the mud could be so\u2026..exhilarating!! As we ran back home, mud butts and all, I was already thinking about the next workout. I was hooked!! By Wednesday, the freakish warm weather quickly turned to snow/ice/blistering cold again but nothing could keep me from the sweaty embrace of the tribe. As the months went by, we did Bojans in 2 ft of snow, we played Sharks and Minnows downtown, we raced in negative degree weather and in bunny ears. We even ran stairs. NP has a weird way of distracting you from realizing you are actually working REALLY hard. **\n\nSadly, chapters close in life and my time with NP came to an end. My husband accepted a job in PHX and we decided to take a chance and move across the country. As I said goodbye to my tribe, that now stood second only to my family, I turned and waved as Brogan said \u201cGoodbye, Erica Holt.\u201d I was so thankful I had been a part of something so wonderful and rewarding! I kept in touch with the tribe over the summer and virtually supported everyone from afar, experiencing serious FOMO (fear of missing out). I sported my [#GrassrootsGear](http://november-project.com/grassrootsgear-video/) proudly in a clueless city so hot I could barely survive a workout without having a heat stroke. Who builds a city in a friggin desert, anyway?!! We lasted a whole 3 months in Phoenix. Once the decision was made to cut our losses and move ALL the way back, the only thing sliver of light to the whole ordeal was returning to November Project.\n\nComing back was unreal! The hugs were amazing but the workouts were harder than ever. I was not as strong or fast as I had been and the calf pain from running those knee high stairs was very much a reality! When I started NP, I never thought it would be anything more than an exercise group. It\u2019s an intense, supportive community of like-minded individuals that inhale motivation and exhale inspiration. It\u2019s impossible not to get caught up in that! Without consciously trying, I\u2019ve PRed my 5k and 10k times, we\u2019ll see about half and full marathon times in the future. I have done more pushups and sit-ups that I ever imagined.

The brave soldiers of sweat and love completed our second edition of Bascom and Get Some, a 20 minute do-as-much-as-you-can-without-puking-unless-you-simply-must workout. Sam Keepman broke his own loop record with dozens of NP faithfuls and newbs crushing it behind him. We then hugged.

Following a spirited warmup of homeless hopscotch, jump-and-say-your-name-jacks, and shuffle-shuffle-claps, the costumed tribe performed 26-minutes of figure-8s bounding up the amphitheater stairs. Roughly one-eighth the size of the mother tribe\u2019s weekly Wednesday conquest, the Denver Tribe sweated right through their Halloween costumes and completed the workout with a familiar gasp of exhaustion and satisfaction. See official race results pictured on [our facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/NovemberProjectDEN).  \nOur costume winners were Liz and Aaron. Liz was our 300 Spartan hero, Gerard Butler, and Aaron was, well, a cow with an udder.

Puppies Running? Pretty Rings? Pirate Rum? All of the aforementioned definitions, while fabulous, don\u2019t even come close to all the PERSONAL RECORDS the NP SD tribe blew up today.

Major props to Melissa on her 5 MINUTE plank, and she wasn\u2019t even shaking! If we weren\u2019t high enough on endorphins, we had our first official grassrootsgear tag session.

I\u2019d love to think that November Project is the coolest thing she\u2019s up to but I know that\u2019s not the case. Get to know Daisy and you\u2019ll have someone who will always greet you with a smile and train with you rain or shine. As we look into the coldest months of the year you can expect to see Daisy learning the rules of layering as this California native is attempting her first New England winter training/playing outside. Without anymore details or jabber, I proudly present to you\u2026 Daisy Robinton.\n\n_Day 1_: Bleary-eyed and half-conscious, I grudgingly rolled out of bed and silently cursed myself for making a verbal the week before. Already I feared the public shaming of We Missed You\u2026, and so I found myself fumbling with the laces of my sneakers while I shook off lingering images from my interrupted dreams.\n\nAs a graduate student in the sciences, my schedule \u2013 while full \u2013 doesn\u2019t start at a specific time each day. Casually strolling in to lab around 10 a.m. was my norm. When I heard about November Project through my teammates at CrossFit I thought it sounded fun, but I initially dismissed it. There was NO WAY I was going to get up before 6:30 a.m. for anything, let along optional exercise. As far as I was concerned, being conscious before 8 a.m. was a crime.\n\n_Flash Forward 14 Months_: come rain or shine my sneakers hit the pavement running with the rest of the NP crew before 8 AM, hell, before 6:30 AM! \n\nWhat changed? \n\nLong hours in the lab started taking their toll. Anyone who has spent time in a wet lab will tell you that for every 10 hours you spend at the bench, 9.5 of those hours will ultimately end up in a failed experiment. To balance out my perpetual failures, I took up CrossFit to maintain mental clarity, stay in shape, and make clear progress towards tangible goals \u2013 at least in one arena of my life!\n\nTwo years into my CrossFit training, the kool-aid started to wear off. I enjoyed the community and intensity of the culture, but the competition and politics began wearing me down physically and mentally. My training started feeling like a burden on top of the obstacles I faced in lab, and slowly I realized that the benefits no longer outweighed the cost. I needed a break, a change of pace. \n\nThat change arrived on a warm day in June as I made my way to the Harvard stadium at 6 a.m. The bitterness I felt for abandoning my warm bed at an ungodly hour melted away with the fog of sleep when I entered the stadium buzzing with hellos and hugs, high fives and positive vibes.\n\nI was immediately swept up by the tribe\u2019s fun spirit and fierce passion for fitness. As we kicked off our sprints with a resounding \u201cFUCK YA,\u201d I felt something activate inside me. Energy from the collective coursed through my body and I found myself involuntarily beaming as I sprinted up my first set of stairs. Later, after I\u2019d recovered my breath and washed away the sweat from our exertions, that energy still radiated from me like a halo. I carried it with me through the rest of the day, and I knew I had found something worth waking up for. \n\nEach person I have met at November Project has enriched my life and contributed to the inspiration I feel every time I show up. Each person who leaves their warm bed behind to join a morning NP workout session imparts energy to the momentum of the NP movement \u2013 momentum that flows into our personal and professional lives and keeps us going through the inevitable ups and downs. I am profoundly grateful for all of the NP members in Boston and around North America who have buoyed me up and inspired me to start my day at the crack of dawn with a sense of accomplishment. I never thought I\u2019d be excited to get out of bed before the sun rolled out of hers. I never thought I\u2019d look forward to early morning runs in the frigid cold, decks in soggy grass, and planks (or double/triple planks!) on the damp cement before breakfast. Now, sharing these moments with my NP family invigorates me. I am beyond grateful to all of you for showing up and contributing to the community. I can\u2019t articulate how much I appreciate Brogan and Bojan\u2019s tireless efforts in building this community, this MOVEMENT. They have held it down from day one, asking for nothing in return. Rain or shine they show up to motivate all of us.

Since human bodies are anywhere from 50%-70% made of water (depending on how long that morning peeing session was), any time you spend extended period of time without proper thermal insulation (clothing) you will eventually get really fucking cold. So please don\u2019t be stupid because I know you\u2019re not and put some layers on when working out. It\u2019s easier to take off a shirt when you\u2019re cold than to shiver like a leaf in your tiny little tanktop and shorts. We like you all and want to make sure that you don\u2019t get sick or injured so please take care of yourself. If you need pointers on how to properly dress for winter, [take some pointers](http://november-project.com/stay-warm-while-running-during-winter-months/) from our friends in Edmonton. \n\nNow the beautiful thing about being cold is that there is a lot of T.H.O.\u2019s floating around.

We had some birthdays (video below) and we had some company. The vibe this morning was different as we felt the fresh faces down in DC training with us and the other 5 tribes preparing to rise and shine. \n\n**NOVEMBER PROJECT JUST HOSTED A COMMUNITY BUILDING, BADASS, FUNNY, AND TOTALLY FREE WORKOUT IN 7 CITIES, INSIDE 4 TIME ZONES, AND IN TWO DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND WE PLAN TO DO IT AGAIN EACH WEDNESDAY FOR THE NEXT TRILLION YEARS**.

Brisk, would be too gentle a term, it was downright Ultra-Brisk. Teddy G, \u2018The Master\u2019 gave the hardest workout in Madison History (We checked with the State Historical Society) called: **Four Scores & 7**. Cold calves warmed up quick \u2013 and as the sun rose over the isthmus the cold faded and sweat prevailed once again! Madison extends a warm, sweaty, extended-length hug to our 3 new brother-cities.

Returning to our roots meant no fancy camera and lots of newbies. Last time we worked out at Kezar the numbers were in the 30\u2032s, so it was a beautiful thing to see double the numbers busting out a solid pre-sunrise sweat session. Laura and Sam also completely forgot it was Ben\u2019s birthday, so he didn\u2019t get to wear the rainbow boa. Next time, Ben, next time. Next week we will be returning to Alamo, **ADDING A FRIDAY HILL WORKOUT**, and welcoming a new leader to the tribe. The tribe has never been stronger. \n\n**EDMONTON NOTES**:  \n_by Nadim_\n\nThis is exactly what [we](http://november-project.com/edmonton-ab-canada/) did today. We ran up stairs, one at a time. Some of us, did two at a time. No one did 3. When we got to the top, we gave a bronze dude high five, then went back down and started all over again until the timekeeper told us we could stop. Then we took a picture.\n\nSpecial thanks to the lighting crew who help setup and take down the lights this/every morning.

As the sun began to rise the neon tribe showed up in full force ready to rock! Starting hump day right with hugs and some politically incorrect sprinting, leader Lauren led the tribe in an ass-kicking, kick ass workout. We all left Kate Sessions today with abs of steel fit for Halloween costumes. We perfected the sexy school girl pose and sprinted like our favorite animals all before breakfast\u2026 and damn it feels good!

This star landed in City Park and was comprised of cousins, roommates, Mid-Westerners, New Englandahs, classmates, coworkers, and a master\u2019s rowing champion. Our links to the homeland November Project tribe were instant ice breakers, and soon thereafter college rivals were airsquat fighting. Today\u2019s workout in Denver\u2019s City Park began with some warm-up \u201cReady Go\u2019s\u201d followed by generously timed circuits of burpees, bicycle crunches, squat hops, and lunges. \n\nWe suffered our first \u201c[We Missed You](http://november-project.com/category/we-missed-you/)\u2018s\u201d due to alarm failures and general \u2018I don\u2019t know what to wear on my hands\u201d.

Good news is we\u2019re [#weatherproof](http://november-project.com/rainorshine-weatherproof/) and the tribe kept growing. The Lincoln Memorial was back open today, so [we](http://november-project.com/washington-dc/) ran what we like to call **Lincoln Loggers**: From the reflecting pool to the top of the stairs at the Lincoln Memorial and back down. 20 \u201clogs\u201d (with scale back options) and between each \u201clog,\u201d [we](http://november-project.com/washington-dc/) did 5 push-ups and 5 burpees. Next week, we race for PRs. We showed the F$%# up, it rained, we ran, we tagged, we made new friends and [dropped more verbals](http://november-project.com/vocabulary/), and then we went home.

This is how SF started our workout. We attempted to give out the \u201cpositivity award\u201d but the recipient did not show. So Laura proceeded to use the award in the only way she knew how, she waved it at people in an aggressive, somewhat threatening manner to get them to do what she wanted. After beginning our relay races, we were blinded by the police search light and got told that after multiple weeks of getting complaints, they finally had to come shut us up. Laura did her best to charm the pants off the Irish officers, even explaining that she was a McC and we may possibly be related. After having a thorough discussion about the mosquitoes and threat of yellow fever, the Irishmen left us alone, and simply told us to \u201cshut the fuck up.\u201d Another successful Wednesday in the books.\n\n**BOSTON NOTES**:  \n_by Bojan_\n\nLike bootie blasting race up and down the 40 sections of the stadium wasn\u2019t enough, this morning we added a spice of 40 air-squats (squat until our buts touched the seats) with the intention of firing quads and hamstrings slightly more than usual.

We gave some hugs and met some newbies including a small but vocal pack that made the trip around the reservoir to represent Boston College. Then we raced. The wet grass and humid air made us think it might still be summer but the fact that it was barely light out reminded us that winter is right around the corner. To work on our #weatherproofing we didn\u2019t avoid the muddy ground but instead embraced it.

Sans leader Laura, who is cheating on us with her ex (never works out like you want it to), the tribe came together as one today in her absence.

We rocked out to a some phone tunes while dominating \u201cTabatas\u201d \u2013 sets of squat jumps, Russian twists, burpees, and sargent jumps with hill loops in between.

This will get your guts and limbs ready for November and the many odd events/stunts that you can expect coming as we celebrate our 2 year birthday.\n\n**RULES**: #deckaday is the classic deck with no substitutes or variation. Each black card represents the number of push-ups you need to complete (2-10, Jack 11, Queen 12, King 13, Ace 14 reps). Each red card is that number of sit-ups (2-10, Jack 11, Queen 12, King 13, Ace 14 reps). Shuffle the deck, lay it face down, flip one card over at a time, work your way through the whole deck, and then head directly to your social media tools to check in and report. Your [form must be spot on for this to count](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh00_rniF8E) \u2013 push-ups with knees on the ground DO count and are respected far more than dudes or gals who do 1/4 pushups and/or terrible booty-sagging/piking form. However try to do as many as you can without dropping down to your knees. Sit-ups are pretty clear\u2026 sit up while keeping your arms crossed over your chest or with your hands behind your head (see photo above). \n\n**POST YOUR DECK**: We don\u2019t need to see fast times but we do need you to post your total deck time along with the hashtag \u201c[#deckaday](http://november-project.com/4-city-october-challenge-a-deck-a-day-deckaday/).\u201d Please Tweet this out to your respective tribe handles ([@Nov_Project_MSN](https://twitter.com/Nov_Project_MSN), [@Nov_ProjectCAN](https://twitter.com/Nov_ProjectCAN), [@Nov_Project_SF](https://twitter.com/Nov_Project_SF) or [@Nov_Project](https://twitter.com/Nov_Project) for those who are roaming fans of NP.

Just make it consistent for all of October by choosing one social media outlet and don\u2019t forget #deckaday.\n\nThe challenge will be hard for most of us because of the need to carve this 15-30something minute block out of each day on our own. In that time you\u2019ll have no tribe watching you flip through the cards, no verbal motivation or daily schedule, its just you, your deck, and your road to improvement.

We timed everyone as they climbed the stairs and then gave our friend Ezio Farone a high five at the top. People could choose between 4, 7 and 10 sets. Only one person hit 10, most did 7 and a brave few pushed themselves to complete 4. Somehow others decided to do \u2018inbetween\u2019 sets, but we\u2019ll forgive you this time. Regardless, you all now have a baseline for your results. We will be timing on the last Wednesday of every month so you will be able to see your progress.

We are going to miss having Connor Green here in the \u201c617\u2033 but we know Laura and our West Coast family will surge forward as he joins NPSF in the coming weeks. Have a great Monday everyone. \n\n**Almost one year has passed since I stumbled upon a group of roughly 200 strangers running the Harvard stadium at the crack of dawn. I was on my way to complete my own workout consisting of a few casual sections and perhaps a few pushups. However, I immediately was drawn in by the energy of the group and shortly thereafter, I decided to join November Project three times a week on a regular basis, through the dead of Boston\u2019s winter. **\n\nBack in the Fall, BG and Bojan urged NP members to post on the group\u2019s FB wall, why do you train with NP? Many tribesmen cited their desire to push their physical limits, to meet new friends in Boston or perhaps to simply have some fun and let loose before beginning a stressful day in the office or classroom. While all of these factors contribute to my NP obsession, what many tribesmen failed to acknowledge is the strength of leadership from delivered by BG and Bojan during MWF workouts. \n\nBG and Bojan set the tone by completing the workouts before any else arrives and then proceed to offer encouragement as the rest of the tribe completes the prescribed exercises. Every MWF, they bring intensity and a great sense of humor, and cheer us on as we race towards PRs and form new friendships. They inspire us to wake up at ungodly to complete workouts that bring us to our breaking points while the rest of Boston hits the snooze button one last time. Throughout the year, I\u2019ve joined the tribe for these 6:30am outdoor workouts in the middle of snowstorms, hurricanes, heat waves and single degree temperatures. Not only do they get us out of bed to train in these conditions, but they make sure we have fun every time we do it. I\u2019ve been involved in athletics my entire life, but BG and Bojan are among the finest leaders I have encountered. They\u2019re the glue that keeps NP Boston together and I\u2019m grateful for their commitment.\n\nThis July marks my final month of training with November Project Boston for the foreseeable future. As I begin a new chapter in San Francisco, I will undoubtedly miss this NP family, but I hope to continue working out with the group in SF. I want to take this opportunity to thank BG and Bojan for all of their hard work and leadership that they have brought (and continue to bring) to the table, and for setting an example of what a few dudes can accomplish when they commit to an idea.  \n\n", "title": "Green Toots Co-Founder\u2019s Horn & Joins NPSF", "url": "http://november-project.com/green-toots-co-founders-horn-joins-npsf/", "workout_entry": true, "author": "brogan", "location": "POINT (-71.0733620000000030 42.3396090000000029)", "date": "2013-07-22", "dow": 0}, "model": "novproj.post", "pk": 146}, {"fields": {"body": "Today was all about working hard and chilling harder.

You know like Mr. Richard Head (not his real name), the security guard that disrupted our already disruptive workout across from Back Bay train station. Mr. Richard Head or just Dick for short threatened to call local law enforcement agency if we didn\u2019t vacate the premises of the private property that he was securing with his flashlight. The reasons for his actions are at this point just speculations. Some say that he was scared of unruly neon spandex mob taking over the Copley sq. Others are citing foul language and highly offensive gang tattoos of the group leaders as inappropriate and threatening for the unsuspecting customers that are visiting his mall during peak business hours between 6:30 and 7:00am. I personally think that our boy Dick Head was just taking his job way to seriously. Dear Dick, if you\u2019re reading this, you have to relax. People that you chased off the courtyard are some of the nicest and friendliest in town. If you took two minutes of your busy patrol schedule to talk to some of them; the worst thing that would happen would be a temporary wet spot on your neatly pressed uniform you\u2019d get from hugging a sweaty member of the tribe. I mean anyone that fluidly transitions from an air-squat to _crayonasanaranga_ (in yoga circles known as \u201cchild drawing with crayons\u201d pose) cannot mean any harm. \n\nSo Dick , whatever is going on in your life that\u2019s making you miserable, take care of it soon. It\u2019s only Monday, man. If you continue at this pace you might not make it to the weekend. Everyone else, if you catch yourself being a buzz kill like Mr. Head, take a deep breath and chill out. \n\nI would like to take a moment and apologize to anyone named Richard Head for using their name to describe miserable mall security guard. I would also like to point out that all people with the last name Head who name their kids Richard are huge assholes! \n\nYour artwork from this morning is now live on [November Project facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/NovProject).

In Boston, it\u2019s possible.  \n**  \nThe homage is symbolic. To celebrate the departure of one of the pillars of the group, they sang the Canadian National Anthem.\n\nThe result won\u2019t go down in history, but the idea is to participate. That is the motto of November Project\n\nWednesday, many dozens of participants saluted Andrew Ference. After seven seasons with the Bruins, the veteran defender departs Boston this weekend to establish himself in his hometown (birthplace) of Edmonton. This past Friday, after the opening of free agent season, he signed a four-year contract with the Oilers.\n\nProfessionally, Ference leaves behind teammates with whom he has experienced indescribably emotional moments, notably when hoisting the precious Stanley Cup.\n\nOn a personal note, he leaves behind a group of individuals that have helped him maintain the physical strength necessary for a 34-year old athlete in the NHL, but more than that, people who have helped him become a better citizen.\n\n\u201cTo be the best person I can be. To be fit, healthy, of course, but also to be part of something bigger. To be a good neighbor and a part of a community\u201d, emphasizes Ference in a telephone interview with Radio-Canada Sports.\n\nNovember Project is a cross between CrossFit and a flash mob. This non-sanctioned community, founded in 2011, is organized with social media and gathers about 200 people three times weekly to workout in the open air.\n\nWith the help of Twitter and Facebook, Brogan Graham and Bojan Mandaric, the two organizers of the project, congregate the tribe for the next morning session.\n\n\u201cMonday, we do push-ups and sit-ups in a different location every week, relates the hockey player. Wednesday, we attack the stadium and its many steps, and Friday, we run hills.\u201d  \nThe community has become a kind of cult for its participants. The two craftsmen of the project, former university level rowers, are not trainers, but motivators.\n\n\u201cHaving a good leader is so important. Everything starts because you want to be there for the other.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter the weather, no matter if they\u2019ve drunk too much beer the night before, they will be there for each other.\u201d\n\n**Before the workout, the hugs  \n**\n\nThe motivation is necessary because rising before dawn is necessary to train at 6:30am. The desire stems from fun, a principle that serves as a foundation of November Project.\n\nIn response to an individualistic society driven by electronic devices, the principal objective of the group is interaction, not getting in shape.\n\n\u201cWe see a generation growing up with Facebook and Twitter, and we thing we are starting to lose the face-to-face interaction and the principle of living in a community, emphasizes Ference. I believe this type of project proves the opposite. That\u2019s what makes it so popular. It is contagious to be in a group of enthusiastic, positive people.\n\n\u201cIf you do one thing like this, it leads to others. This type of project is the spark that motivates you to be involved.\u201d\n\nFerence joined November Project because he already practiced this type of exercise, but alone. For him, the work of the team is more fun and stimulating. His initiative is the image of a new generation of hockey players, more open minded and who wish to try out new things.  \n\u201cYou can\u2019t create one training program for all the players on a team. Zdeno Chara has needs that are different from mine\u201d, he suggests.\n\n\u201cWith all the information available now, if you want to try something different, now is the time!\u201d\n\nFerence would like to find volunteers to launch a Alberta version of November Project in Edmonton. He lacks only an inspirational leader, he says. Similar groups have already been formed in Chicago, Houston, New York and Denver.\n\n**Oilers, the time is now  \n**  \nWith the Oilers, Ference adopts the same attitude as with his training partners.  \n\u201cThe most beautiful lesson I learned through the course of my career is to always dive in head first, he avows. Don\u2019t dip your toes in the water, dive.\u201d\n\nClose to his family and his friends, he does not fear the pressure. Especially as the young Oilers begin to feel it.\n\n\u201cThe word that we hear most often to describe this team is potential. They would like to stop hearing that and start to be described as warriors of the series.\u201d says Ference.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken with several guys in the last few days. I sensed they have a real desire to eliminate the negative connotation and to prove themselves. It is really cool to arrive in such an atmosphere.\u201d\n", "title": "The Uncommon Training of Andrew Ference (english version)", "url": "http://november-project.com/the-uncommon-training-of-andrew-ference-english-version/", "workout_entry": true, "author": "bojan", "location": "POINT (-71.0635000000000048 42.3581000000000003)", "date": "2013-07-11", "dow": 3}, "model": "novproj.post", "pk": 151}, {"fields": {"body": "**BOSTON NOTES**: \n\nWith our good friend [Andrew Ference](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RtaWzmx1Zg) on his very last day with us at November Project Boston we were happy to have a few great things going on. **ONE**: [#FrogMan1](http://november-project.com/frogman1/) at our classic [Wednesday](http://november-project.com/stadium/) location at Harvard Stadium.

Today, our guest post comes from the guy that\u2019s been training with the tribe for five short months. On his last day before taking on the new challenges that may land them anywhere from Dallas to Chicago, he remembers his first and a hopefully not the last day with NP. \n\nLadies and Gentleman, Rishabh Mallick. \n\n_6:26AM Feb. 13th, 2013._\n\nFour days have passed since a brutal winter storm crippled this city.\n\nI walk up to the crowd of athletes huddling together, awaiting the expected decision of a substitute stadium workout due to the accumulated snow. The decision is reached; we are instructed onto the field adjacent to the stadium. Virgin snow still blankets the field.\n\nHop, hop, hop \u2013 stumble. Eight seconds in, and I\u2019ve already managed to lose my footing in the knee-deep snow. As regain my stature, Brogan & Bojan encourage us to hug a stranger and wish them a good morning. I cheat. I hug my friend Laura.\n\nWe\u2019re informed of our substitute hump day workout: 20 minute continuous circuit interchanging sprints and jogs \u2013 through the frozen field.\n\nBojan is our time keeper. He starts our first sprint circuit. I pull one ear bud out to listen to his cues. I quickly realize how difficult running through a foot of snow/ice is. Out of breath, during the \u201cjogging rest\u201d circuit, I check my watch: 5:38. I still had more than fifteen minutes left in my kind gesture of plowing the snow for the Grounds crew at Harvard.\n\nThe next thirteen minutes are just as cruel to my legs as the first five. I examine my ankles. Blood is trickling onto my socks from the repetitive scraping against the harden snow. I pause a minute to examine the extent of my injury. I quickly triage it as a shallow cut, but I remain hunched over for another 20 seconds in an attempt to catch my breath.\n\nAnd then it happens. A stranger whose face I do not recall, whispers in a voice I do not recognize: \u201cTwo more minutes. You got this. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nI come alive. An insatiable beast that thrives on pain exalts my body from the depths of fatigue. I ignore the sprint and jog cues from Bojan. I sprint till the workout ends.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSadly, today is my last day as a resident of Boston. While my home of five years has provided me with many friends, adventures and life experiences, few have been as rewarding as November Project. For me, the tribe was never about physical exertion. Long before my first NP workout in January, I had committed to working out every day \u2013 a streak still alive today at 421. Rather, NP provided me with a community in an endeavor that I initially believed to be solitary. The kindness of strangers, the positive attitude of athletes and the commitment of Bostonians is what kept me coming back to NP.\n\nAnd honestly, there is no greater gift in life than being surrounded by good people.\n\n#hardbodies with #kindsouls\n\nThank you \u2013 November Project.\n\nRishabh\n", "title": "Guest Post by Rishabh", "url": "http://november-project.com/guest-post-by-rishabh/", "workout_entry": true, "author": "bojan", "location": "POINT (-71.1130430000000047 42.3344700000000032)", "date": "2013-06-28", "dow": 4}, "model": "novproj.post", "pk": 156}, {"fields": {"body": "Today our tribe had different workout experience.

So when BG and I whip out those cowbells and start yelling like someone is pulling the skin of our backs we don\u2019t do it because we think that throwing in 50-60 pushups will make you faster at running stairs, we do it so the time you spend doing pushups is not being spend obsessing over your projected final time.

The next day, Friday, he was standing proud on top of Summit Ave with November Project in the rain. We hugged, we ran hills, and we shared a connected community experience. Here is what David, Editor-in-Chief of Runner\u2019s World, thought of his first day at NP as a newbie.\n\n**BOSTON NOTES: **\n\nBecause I am lucky to work at a company where health and fitness are part of the daily culture, I often get to run at lunch or at reasonable times before/after work. So I rarely have to wake up before 6 AM for a workout. But on my first visit back to Boston after the marathon bombings, I was psyched to set my phone to summon me at 5:30 this morning so I could finally experience the November Project for my ownself.\n\nI had heard about it from RW colleagues and friends at New Balance (nice work, Claire Wood, somehow \u201clanding\u201d in the foreground of that giant photo in Outside magazine\u2013have you no shame?). They set expectations very high, and those can be hard to meet\u2013especially in the pouring rain, especially when the half-mile hill you know you are about to run multiple times has a grade of 17% near the top.\n\nSummit Ave was silent and slick when I arrived at 6:15. Before long I was hugging people I\u2019d never met before, remembering (yet again) how many reasons there are to be grateful and glad I am a runner. Five times up and down, trying to do my talking on the downs and my quivering on the ups. But this was one of the best runs I\u2019ve done in a long time. Not because I nailed the workout (I certainly did not) but because it was so easy and instantaneous to plug into a cool, unique community vibe\u2013especially now, especially in Boston. By the time we were done, the Summit Ave denizens were just heading to work. I love that. This winter and spring, I have too often run alone and too often forgotten to have fun. Thanks, NPers, for welcoming this Newbie and for the wake-up call. You\u2019ve got something really great going on. I look forward to next time and will blame Brogan if I start sweaty-hugging my RW colleagues on the lunch run. \n\n-David Willey, November Project Member (Boston)\n", "title": "David Willey (NP BOS Newbie) & Dan Graham (NP MSN Leader) Share Their Thoughts", "url": "http://november-project.com/david-willey-np-bos-newbie-dan-graham-np-msn-leader-share-their-thoughts/", "workout_entry": true, "author": "brogan", "location": "POINT (-71.0635000000000048 42.3581000000000003)", "date": "2013-06-15", "dow": 5}, "model": "novproj.post", "pk": 162}, {"fields": {"body": "**SF NOTES**: \n\nWords from Laura McCloskey\u2026 SF leader, chalk artist, NU Track & Field Alum, November Project Uganda\u2026\n\n\u201cOnly one stadium employee yelled at us today.

Looking back, this was a very good thing as we had to work harder to make new friends. Over the years this city has opened up as we continued to interact with people we didn\u2019t know, high-five unsuspecting runners during our river loops, and crack mid-level jokes at bars, bike racks, and even urinals/bathroom stalls hoping to get a laugh or even a smirk out of those serious faces.\n\nFast forward to 2013 and we have come to a place where November Project, the hugging, racing, and community building tribe, is ON FIRE. The good vibes that kept us warm during Boston Nor\u2019easters, Madison winters, and San Francisco cold rains, are undeniable.

An example of a **UNSUSPECTING RANDOM ACT OF KINDNESS** could be paying the toll for the vehicle behind you, picking up a round of coffee for people you always see in the morning on the way to work, or giving your jacket to a runner that looks cold during early morning hours. But please do not Tweet, post, or brag about anything you do for this homework assignment. Bragging about doing nice things defeats the purpose of that very same act.

Now, when I asked **Morgan Brown**, a tall, overly chill, and quietly athletic NP (Boston) member if he\u2019d be interested in writing, I was a little thrown off when he wasn\u2019t really too pumped to take the job. This dude is so pro NP but he doesn\u2019t want to e-hype himself? This was a lot to take in\u2026 especially for me\u2026 a many of many words. In the past few weeks of training on trail during the afternoon with this dude I\u2019ve had my suspicions about him confirmed; Morgan DOES have a layered, twisting tale with volumes of stories that will one day (hopefully) be in his book. These gems are kept hidden under the quiet personality you may or may not have yet to encounter. A [recent](http://www.gocrimson.com/sports/bsb/coaches/Brown_Morgan) timeline that takes him all over the world in the last half decade, directly following a few casual years of pro baseball in more than one continent\u2026 oh\u2026 and lets not forget the chapters that came before pro ball as he was a Division 1 All-American after **walking on** to Harvard\u2019s Baseball team during his undergrad years.

I haven\u2019t won the [positivity award](http://november-project.com/positivity-award-nov_project/). For almost a year now I have been to every workout with a very few exceptions. Now, this could be because my general demeanor and outward personality has a number of similarities to say, cardboard, but I am going to take this in another direction.**\n\nIt is a very good thing that I have not won the positivity award.\n\nThis means that over the past year, as the numbers of attendees have swelled from a few handfuls to a [few hundred](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RtaWzmx1Zg)\u2026on a slow day\u2026 there has been a continual stream of positive, enthusiastic, and consistent folks showing up week after week.\n\nWhere did they all come from? I certainly didn\u2019t recruit them (recall the aforementioned characteristics of my personality).\n\nThey come from all corners of the city, from Somerville to Dorchester, the North End to Jamaica Plain.  \nFitness and building community and positive starts to the day for hundreds of people in this city (and now Madison and San Francisco) is a good thing. \n\nIt is especially a good thing when, despite the sometimes unwieldy swell in numbers and herd mentality we have the good sense to be considerate and quiet in the mornings, knowing that not everyone wants to be woken up and chose the same lifestyle as our group. This is building community as well.  \nI heard that these two former college athletes had created this group to foster similar levels of accountability to playing a collegiate sport, you had to show up because other people were showing up, depending on you, everyone was pulling on the same rope, in the same conditions, rain or shine. That idea appealed to me, along with the \u201c[race everything](http://november-project.com/race-yeah-we-like-to-race/)\u201d slogan. Times were posted, accountability was ensured via public humiliation on facebook. After injuries curtailed a previous athletic career, and then living overseas for most of the last five years, I missed the engagement of being in a competition amongst teammates that lead to better results. I was dangerously close to becoming \u201ca jogger\u201d if I didn\u2019t have someone to run with, so I have enjoyed the thrice weekly event of getting up and running with a group of similarly motivated folks, and while you may not notice it from me, I appreciate the positive and friendly nature of those around me. Perhaps most of all, I appreciate the fact that I am starting to look forward to improving, racing and competing again. \n\nSee you [Wednesday](http://november-project.com/stadium/).\n", "title": "November Project by TheCardboardRacer (Guest Words by Morgan Brown)", "url": "http://november-project.com/november-project-by-thecardboardracer-guest-words-by-morgan-brown/", "workout_entry": true, "author": "brogan", "location": "POINT (-71.0921400000000006 42.3156999999999996)", "date": "2013-05-27", "dow": 0}, "model": "novproj.post", "pk": 170}, {"fields": {"body": "Great work in Brookline this morning.

If we get more dudes and gals like him to fill in the gaps between all of the regular racers we\u2019ll all go faster as we try and catch those just a few feet in front of us, while fending off those who are attempting to chase us down. **This is racing** and this is why we love building the group in size. More racers = smaller gaps between moving bodies = we all push harder = faster times. Guys under 26 minutes and girls under 29 minutes are considered fast.

If you stop at the top or the bottom of any section you\u2019re breaking your rhythm both physically and mentally. You\u2019re also holding up those who\u2019re ready to \u201cturn & go.\u201d Not cool. Take your time coming down the exit rows strategically as your active recovery. If I\u2019ve used too many words in this section I\u2019ll break it down like this; **PLEASE DON\u2019T STOP**. I love you. \n\n**5.** From now on, [#GrassrootsGear](http://november-project.com/grassrootsgear/) will only be painted on the last Wednesday of the month to those who finish a full tour with a PR time. If you\u2019re not yet up to 37 sections you can use this as a goal. When you do have a piece of gear you\u2019d like marked up with NP love, please keep it to one, light colored top. We\u2019ll be painting the chest with black paint so make it count as you pick your gear. PR each month for multiple pieces of gear. Being inside race season we love having you represent the tribe as you show your speed. (Many pieces of [#GrassrootsGear](http://november-project.com/grassrootsgear/) at Reach The Beach & Harpoon\u2019s 5M this weekend \u2013 Love it.)\n\n**6.** Recruit. I literally talk to everyone I see that looks like they may need fitness, hugs, fun, racing, or community, in a stronger dose than what they\u2019re currently getting in their day-to-day. Because of consistant recruiting, newbies are going to come check out NP in herds this spring and summer. Welcome them and continue to recruit the right, fun lovin\u2019 folks to our tribe. \n\n**7.** Not a rule: We had a great workout this morning at [#BerginPark](http://november-project.com/all-may-mon-all-damn-may-4-destinationdeck-locations-for-may-2013/) in Cambridge. Follow the plans for next Monday for our last Monday in [#ALLMAYMON](http://november-project.com/all-may-mon-all-damn-may-4-destinationdeck-locations-for-may-2013/) and plan your week starting with your run to smiles. \n\n**8.** Your \u201c[No Snooze for NB Shoes](http://november-project.com/no-snooze-for-new-shoes-nov_project-nov_project_msn-newbalance/)\u201d have arrived for the tribe in Boston!

Thus, I present to you a descriptive but not exhaustive list: **\n\nThe Ten Commandments of November Project*\n\n(*I can only speak of what I know, and that is the Boston chapter. I\u2019m taking this to mean I must travel to Wisconsin and San Francisco to learn of the ways and the workouts, and then come back and edit accordingly). \n\n**1.** Honour thy verbal. Your alarm clock won\u2019t pump you full of legal highs via endorphins, so turn it off and get yourself moving. We\u2019ve been known to enjoy many a game at NP, but \u201cIt\u2019s 6:30 am, do you know where your tribe member is?\u201d has never been a favorite. Let us not forget how our hurt emotions may manifest themselves. [#WeMissedYou](http://november-project.com/category/we-missed-you/)\n\n**2.** Thou shalt recruit. Not only is there strength in numbers, there\u2019s also more men sans shirts and women in tiny shorts. Do your part.\n\n**3.** Thou shalt sport [#GrassrootsGear](http://november-project.com/grassrootsgear/) proudly. Thou shalt sport it on the stairs, thou shalt sport it when in chairs. Thou shalt sport it in a race, thou shalt sport it on thy face. Thou shalt sport it here and there, thou shalt sport it everywhere.\n\n**4.** Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour\u2019s ass. While technically one of the recognized original commandments, we\u2019re not talking donkeys at NP; we\u2019re talking behinds, and it\u2019s easy enough to obtain a choice piece of one\u2019s own by repeated [#FrogMan1](http://november-project.com/frogman1/)\u2019s.\n\n**5.** Honour thy B&B. Like an overly-aggressive set of stage mothers, they are here to inspire, celebrate, push, but perhaps most importantly, unabashedly shame us into doing our best. Make sure to, on occasion, give them extra hugs for their hard work. \n\n**6.** Thou shalt not take the name of the [#PositivityAward](http://november-project.com/positivity-award-nov_project/) in vain. That weathered piece of wood spent its early days drinking the Charles River, a body of water you wouldn\u2019t voluntarily ingest after 27 full frontals on Summit Ave, and it *still* has a positive outlook on life. RESPECT.\n\n**7.** Thou shalt not drive to Monday workouts. [#DestinationDeck](http://november-project.com/destination-deck/) is a RUN-DECK/RANDOM CHALLENGING ACTIVITIES-RUN situation, and while all zero-to-four-legged beings are welcome, four-wheeled vehicles are not. While we\u2019re talking cars, thou shalt not park on Summit Ave.\n\n**8.** Thou shalt remember the ways of the ninja. With each high five you give, with every [#FuckYeah](http://november-project.com/vocabulary/) you yell, with every grunt you exhale across a stadium, a Brookline hill, a Boston neighborhood, always bear in mind: you can (and must) transform into a ninja at the drop of a shiny New Balance sneaker.\n\n**9.** Thou shalt enjoy thyself. NP is about the [#RiseAndShine](http://november-project.com/vocabulary/) and the [#MoveAndShake](http://november-project.com/vocabulary/). No matter how much coffee it\u2019s going to take to make it through the workday, Mon/Wed/Fri 6:30 am \u2013 7:30 am is about [#EarningYourEverything](http://november-project.com/vocabulary/) with people who genuinely enjoy seeing you succeed. Make sure to reflect on that every now and again.\n\n**10.** Thou shalt not kill. I actually borrowed this from the original Ten Commandments, but it seemed applicable across all situations, somewhat good advice to keep in your back pocket.\n\nWhile I\u2019m still on my soapbox, I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t thank you all for being the best group of inspirators and perspirators I\u2019ve ever met. Because of you, I\u2019ve pushed myself to physical limits that, perhaps I knew I could, but had never particularly wanted to in the past. I think that\u2019s an important distinction to make: it\u2019s not that you\u2019re showing me what I\u2019m capable of (though certainly in some cases, you have), it\u2019s that you make me want to do it. For me, that\u2019s always the most challenging wall to climb. So, thank you.

This step is huge. We look forward to watching your week fill out with both days until [#DestinationDecks](http://november-project.com/destination-deck/) begin making you look at maps of the isthmus in a whole new way. In honor of the big push this week in \u201cMadTown\u201d we asked one of the most consistant members of the group to write her take on NP. How is it being being a mom, and what it means to get slower, bigger, with her second child on the way, while training with November Project Madison. . Without another word\u2026 our good friend Leanne \u2018Hughes\u2019 Johnson!\n\n**I\u2019ll be completely honest. I joined November Project because one of my best friends and running buddies started the Madison chapter, and I wanted to run with him. Also, after all the Boston hype, I wanted to see what this NP stuff was all about. That\u2019s what got me started, but it isn\u2019t what keeps me coming back.  \nThree years ago I entered a new chapter in my life that I\u2019m still navigating. I grew, gave birth to, and have successfully kept alive (which I\u2019m told is the goal), a happy and healthy two year old daughter. Before pregnancy and motherhood, I was committed, almost obsessed, with eating healthy, getting in my weekly workouts, and reaching my calorie burn. I also fell in love with running halfs, so I was always training for the next one, pushing for the next PR, which kept me pretty motivated. Pregnancy and motherhood forced me to relax and truly appreciate my body and all its potential, something I\u2019m very grateful for.**\n\nDuring my first pregnancy, I had to stop running around 5 months due to pressure and discomfort, which was extremely hard, but at the same time was the best thing for the baby. When the November Project Madison chapter started, I was around 4 months pregnant with baby #2 and still successfully running, but it was the dead of winter\u2026in Wisconsin. And while I totally respect a weather-proof workout, I was less then thrilled that first Wednesday when I showed up bundled in 4 layers of workout clothes, still freezing, and was met with a bunch of smiling, almost giddy faces [(see video here \u2013 bottom of the page)](http://november-project.com/non-dry-hump-day/). \u201cWhy are you all so happy? It sucks out here?\u201d\n\nAnd then something happened. I did the workout and it clicked. Although I was back in a good fitness routine, November Project gave me what I didn\u2019t even realize I\u2019d been craving. NP helped me to push myself and challenge my body in ways that I just wasn\u2019t able to do by myself. And the funny part is, to me, November Project isn\u2019t all that focused on the workout, or your time, or how good your butt looks in 6 layers of spandex. It\u2019s about the community and the energy. Everyone working together to push and encourage each other through brutal workouts that 99% of people would never do alone. \n\nNovember Project helps gets you back to that childlike enthusiasm which is about just being active and not going through the motions simply to complete a workout. Every week, you meet before sunrise to hug and hang with your friends, and then run around and play. I guarantee there is no better start to your day, and I promise you won\u2019t want the workout to end.\n\nSo here I sit, almost 7 months along in my 2nd pregnancy and I\u2019m still running. I\u2019m the only one at NP getting slower and bigger each week, and I couldn\u2019t be happier. I treat every run as if it might be my last for a while, which forces me to appreciate each step. November Project reconnected me with my competitive, playful self, and has trained me in ways I just couldn\u2019t have done on my own. I can confidently say I don\u2019t think I\u2019d still be running if it weren\u2019t for NP. And it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt that I\u2019m smiling and hugging you all before 6:30 am. \n\nSee you at Lincoln.\n", "title": "NOVEMBER PROJECT by Leanne \u2018Hughes\u2019 Johnson @Nov_Project_MSN", "url": "http://november-project.com/november-project-by-leanne-hughes-johnson-nov_project_msn/", "workout_entry": true, "author": "brogan", "location": "POINT (-71.0635000000000048 42.3581000000000003)", "date": "2013-05-15", "dow": 2}, "model": "novproj.post", "pk": 175}, {"fields": {"body": "This morning was amazing.

Ladies and gents\u2026 Becca MacRae!\n\nI initially joined the November Project because I was training for a race, but I have continued to train/play with NP because I am addicted to the enthusiasm, warmth, and drive of its members. Before NP, I would sometimes get up early to train, but when my alarm went off I would begrudgingly roll out of bed. With NP we work incredibly hard and yet, now when my alarm goes off I am excited to meet the tribe.  \nEach day with NP is about being in motion and keeping fit by having fun. Workouts may leave you spent physically, but each day rejuvenates you mentally and the vivacity carries you through your entire day. After NP workouts I smile more, I eat healthier foods, and I set higher goals for myself in the non-physical aspects of my life. Although I derive this momentum from every NP workout, for me each day emphasizes a different aspect of NP. Monday decks are about refreshing exploration of our city. Wednesday stadiums are about challenging our personal expectations, both mental and physical. Friday Summit Ave hills are about ritual and solidity. Mondays and Wednesdays are proud and loud, but Fridays capture the quiet essence of NP.\n\nWe start every Friday in near silence, huddled close together. At first, I worried that silence (out of respect for our Summit Ave resident friends) would detract from the NP energy, but now I appreciate that the quiet in fact contributes to and strengthens the vibe. Sometimes we bounce when it is cold. Sometimes we whisper-sing happy birthday and crowd-surf the birthday girl over our heads. We always hug. Then we start the workout all together. Maybe today is an Indiana Jones day, maybe it\u2019s a 1-hill sprint day, maybe it\u2019s a 3-6-9 repeats day. Regardless, the silence gives you the opportunity to feel, rather than hear, the tribe\u2019s collective support. There are high-fives from people running down for the people running up and whispered encouragements from the faster runners to the slower runners. We run together as one tribe, one Boston. Then, after we finish we linger to chat, learn about each other\u2019s lives, and make plans for the weekend together.\n\nEvery Friday follows the same pattern (with spice here and there of course) and I look forward to this consistency. Fridays are about earning our weekends. Fridays are about reaping the rewards of our hard work that week. Fridays are about taking a moment to quietly and collectively appreciate the unity of our NP community. Fridays are by far my favorite November Project day. \u2013 Rebecca MacRae, November Project.\n\n**MONDAY**: Our location on Monday will be [#ProspectHillPark](http://november-project.com/all-may-mon-all-damn-may-4-destinationdeck-locations-for-may-2013/) in Somerville.

You already saw the piece that [Derrick You-Shall-Not-Cross](http://november-project.com/by-derrick-shallcross/) kindly shared on Monday. Today we\u2019re talking to FJ.\n\nAt this point each one of you have met our boy FJ. He\u2019s hands down one of fittest, most positive, most social media connected dudes, that spends his weekends leading super chill running group that loves to thrown down a good brunch after a workout. He also ended up on the \u201c[We Missed You](http://november-project.com/we-missed-you-this-morning-fj/)\u201d wall once but apologized so hard that we immidiatelly felt like assholes for spending even a second on tarnishing his good name. This morning FJ ran few sections of Harvard stadium with a backpack big enough to fit Brogan and Bojan and two Hubway bikes in it, so we asked him to share his thoughts on why he trains with the tribe and what\u2019s stadium workout means to him. \n\nLadies and Gentleman, the one and only \u2013 Fighter Jet:\n\nFor anyone who likes to push their physical boundaries and test their mental limits \u2013 there\u2019s a lot to love about the November Project and the weekday workouts that get people out of their beds at an ungodly hour, and pounding the pavement with droves of other people, not unlike how I imagine a typical morning in the Serengeti. People from every corner of the city gathering in a great migration that begins and ends before most people have had their first cup of coffee. It\u2019s a pretty captivating thing to witness, and even more amazing to be a part of \u2013 ask anyone who has ever done push-ups and sit-ups in the morning dew (or frost), heard a collective \u201cGood Morning\u201d/\u201cFuck YEAH\u201d echo around Harvard Stadium, or watched the sun rise over Summit Avenue. In many ways these workouts have connected me more to the city I live in, and the people I live in it with. \n\nFor me that connection is most abundantly clear in Harvard Stadium. There\u2019s something visceral about standing at the bottom of Section 37 and looking out at something that was built to look like a MotherEffing coliseum. I can\u2019t think of a more epic and appropriate setting for all the personal and shared struggles we face during the NP workouts. In what is probably one of the most diverse collections of people training together, I\u2019m surrounded by people preparing for things across the broadest spectrum \u2013 training for an athletic event, rehabbing from an injury, getting back in the saddle after having a child, or overcoming some sort of personal barrier, the list goes on. The magic is that inside the walls of Harvard Stadium these people are ALL training together. The Tri-athlete is learning from the Olympic rower, who is supporting the weekend warrior, who is pushing the mother of 3, who carpools with the accountant, who is trying to recruit the guy-that-used-to play-college-sports. The point is that everyone is finding support from people they wouldn\u2019t have otherwise met, let alone train with, and I just think having this all go down in a coliseum is pretty bad ass.\n\nI also realized that the Stadium offers me the following:\n\n37 sections to feel my legs, my back, my body, which all hurt, but Fuck YEAH, I\u2019m alive and moving! 37 sections to be reminded that I\u2019m capable of more than I think\u2026and reminded that someone else is always going to be more capable than me \u2013 and that\u2019s OK, but I\u2019m still gonna try to catch them. 37 sections to find inspiration in the people around me \u2013 a parent running with their child strapped to their back, a dude as old as my gramps hoofing it along with me, a girl half my size smoking me on her return leg of a double burger (OK, no one is half my size, but you get my point), or someone at some stage of taking control of their fitness, their body, and their life. This last part is important, because for me this is the reason that I train. To paraphrase a wise friend: \u201clife is always changing \u2013 you\u2019ve got no control over that. What you can do is take control of as many factors that are in your power, so that you\u2019re driving that change instead of being at the mercy of it.\u201d At the end of the day, I\u2019m trying to make sure I don\u2019t get beat down by life. The dedication it takes to get up for a workout, the discipline it takes to set a goal and achieve it, and consciously opening myself up to connecting with everyone around me \u2013 all of these things transcend the workouts and positively impact my life. \n\nFor me the stadium is a perfect example of how we should all strive to be and offers an environment we should all strive to create outside of the November Project. There are No Judgments, Only Acceptance \u2013 We\u2019re going out of our way to build people up, and not break them down. We\u2019re stepping outside of our comfort zone and making some genuine connections in the process. Also, we\u2019re surrounded by some pretty dope ass music. Of course there are exceptions to the rule, there always will be. But for about an hour or so on Wednesday mornings roughly between 6:30 and 7:30, I feel more connected to city I live in, and the people I live in it with. \n\nSee you dudes on the Stairs!\n\nFJet \n\n**WISCONSIN NOTES (scores):**\n", "title": "Stadium; From the Perspective of Fighter Jet", "url": "http://november-project.com/stadium-from-a-perspective-of-fighter-jet/", "workout_entry": true, "author": "bojan", "location": "POINT (-71.0635000000000048 42.3581000000000003)", "date": "2013-05-08", "dow": 2}, "model": "novproj.post", "pk": 179}, {"fields": {"body": "There is no question that Derrick Shallcross is one of the most committed NP members we have here in Boston. He shovels, hugs, runs with his wife, rocks [#GrassrootsGear](http://november-project.com/grassrootsgear/) harder than most, races his ass off, co-creates pre-event hype events, takes in brunch, and is consistently as upbeat as Flashman & Gilroy sitting in the front row at Cirque du Soleil. Today we invite Derrick to share his perspective on today\u2019s Dorchester location. Without further adieu, Derrick Shallcross: \n\nBrogan and Bojan have probably asked each of you at some point what you\u2019re training for. I am training to day-hike the [presidential traverse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Traverse). What does that have to do with running 10+ miles through Dorchester this morning? More than you might think. That day I\u2019ll be getting up at 4:30 in the morning, making this morning\u2019s 5:30 alarm an easy training start comparatively. I\u2019ll probably be tired, hungry, sore, and a little bit cold, just like today when I stepped outside to a brisk, foggy, nearly deserted Beacon Street. The real similarity, however, comes down to why. When I decided to train for the Presi Traverse I did it for two reasons: 1) to push my physical boundaries and 2) to explore somewhere I\u2019ve never been before. When B&B planned [#AllMayMon](http://november-project.com/all-may-mon-all-damn-may-4-destinationdeck-locations-for-may-2013/) I can\u2019t help but think that they had something similar in mind. \n\nI know that this morning I pushed my physical boundaries. After a week of NP, Yoga (tougher for me than a [#DoubleBurger](http://november-project.com/tiptoptodd-doubleburgers-veggieburgers-all-free-nov_project/)), and BBR my body was creaky as my good friend Siri began guiding me through quiet streets. What began as a run, however, soon turning into an adventure. Despite having lived in Boston for almost a year and having logged many miles throughout it\u2019s streets, much of what I saw today was new. Down side streets and main roads I ran, letting Siri guide me on what I hoped was the shortest route possible. My view was not the expansive sights you get from atop a ridge line. Instead it was places like The Hair Kingdom, Dom\u2019s Auto Repair, and the now defunct Hampden Automotive Sales Corp, viewed in early morning light as if all the inhabitants had disappeared. It was an exploration as much as any hike. By the time Ronan Park came into view along with the small group of smiling faces who made it out this morning I was almost sad to have it be done (almost). I knew that on the way home the same route would have more people, more cars, more noise and I would crank up my music and retrace my steps, the sights no longer new to me. \n\nIn many ways today\u2019s run was also a metaphor for what NP has meant to me in a larger sense. Why do I go to this early morning workout group that\u2019s more than just a workout group? It has pushed me to run faster and be stronger. More than that, my community of fellow NPers has encouraged me to push my physical limits outside of MWF. Yoga, Trialthlons, Hikes, Canoe Races, I\u2019ve done or plan to do them all with fellow NPers. Most importantly, NP has pushed me to explore. To explore the city I was still very new to when I joined NP, and to explore it\u2019s people. The people I used to pass every day as I ran, biked, and walked Boston\u2019s street but never knew. They are now the people who I call my friends, my tribe, and who will push me to explore and meet me at the end with a hug rain or shine (literally and figuratively). They are also people you might just see next Monday if you don\u2019t get lost on the way to [#ProspectHillPark](https://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF-8&q=prospect+hill+park+somerville&fb=1&gl=us&hq=prospect+hill+park&hnear=0x89e377297bf5e165:0x7a907799d8f97b03,Somerville,+MA&cid=0,0,2357200104016752634&ei=X-aDUfT2Oc6s0AGvwIGICA&ved=0CLgBEPwSMAM). **\\- Derrick Shallcross** (center in red, directly in front of [#MrBirdman](http://november-project.com/vocabulary/))\n\n**TUESDAY**: RSVP goes LIVE for [#NP_Yoga @southbostonyoga](http://november-project.com/np_yoga4-southbostonyoga-by-todd-skoglund/).

Most others were silent. \n\nAt 6:30AM, when you were all finally there waiting to start your hug session, I mean workout, I froze up a little bit. A sea of faces lit by a fresh spring sunrise.

A group as active and as proud as ours can be what changes and pushes this city forward in the days ahead. Don\u2019t worry about seeming weird, just say HELLO to all people in your day. Congratulate people on their BAA marathon jackets and greet officers and service agents. Their reaction (good or bad) doesn\u2019t matter, maybe they\u2019ll do the same thing a few blocks later. Thank your MBTA driver or fellow co-workers or professors or students\u2026 or anyone who you should thank for simply being a Boston contributor.

This was an open, all levels class that brought many of us to a yoga mat for the first time. After a summer and fall with Goldie as our fearless yogi leader we moved closer to the Commons with Aaron Cantor\u2019s Yoga Conditioning inside the all mighty Back Bay Yoga.

We\u2019ll pretend like you didn\u2019t just ask that and remind you that Todd is not only the owner of South Boston Yoga, but also a big name in the Boston yoga community.

That doesn\u2019t mean you need to be able to do a split or even touch your toes. But you must be present in the room and motivate your self to do your best and know your own limits. A challenging practice is what helped me break through my own crap. It\u2019s what I know, what helped me, and therefore what I teach. When I\u2019m balancing on my hands, or carefully working into an advanced stretch, I HAVE to be in the present moment and fully focused.

The studio occupies two floors with four studios, showers, lockers, retail, 2 massage rooms, and plenty of room to spread out! We have 2 fully equiped yoga studios on the 3rd floor that can combine into one of the largest studio spaces in Boston. We have a Hot Studio for hot power yoga, and an Aerial/Swing room for Aerial Yoga, Pilates, Core conditioning, and more.  \r\nOur hope is to provide a center with something for everyone, from beginners to advanced practitioners, to enjoy.

You\u2019re missing many updates and jokes from your NP friends and family, so please get on it today. \n\n**WEDNESDAY** ([location](http://november-project.com/stadium/)), **FRIDAY** ([location](http://november-project.com/summit-ave/)), **SUNDAY** (Huevos), & **WISCONSIN NOTES**\u2026 \n\n**WEDNESDAY**: Because we\u2019re going to have some logistical items to get through ([NB Waivers & YEARBOOK PHOTOS](http://november-project.com/fame-yearbook-photos-next-week-nov_project/)) we\u2019ll need all of your help and patience with this pre-workout plan. Also, we hope that some of you can will arrive between 6:10AM and 6:25AM to spread out the rush. Plan to enter through gate 37 and be told where to go\u2026 if you have any new gear\u2026 maybe something new that you earned today from NB, you could plan to wear that\u2026 just a thought. We\u2019ll be hitting you hard with [YEARBOOK PHOTOS](http://november-project.com/fame-yearbook-photos-next-week-nov_project/) before the workout so plan to brush at least your front row of teeth before leaving your house. If you have your completed NB Waiver please bring it with you and if you don\u2019t we\u2019ll have one waiting for you to fill out.\n\n[#GrassrootsGear](http://november-project.com/grassrootsgear-video/) will be happening. After all, [#GrassrootsGear](http://november-project.com/grassrootsgear-video/) is being seen beyond Boston & Madison these days\u2026 Team USA & Olympic Gold Medalist (London 2012), Esther Lofgren, joined us for a week back in the fall and currenly trains in her [#GrassrootsGear](http://november-project.com/grassrootsgear-video/) at the Olympic Training Center to stay connected with us from a distance ([video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=CZr7raXHyrk)). Paint donations in the form of a can or two of black, flat, Krylon would be much appreciated \u2013 gloss is no good, black is a must. Black, flat, Krylon spray paint. \n\n**FRIDAY**: Tick, tick, tick, BBOOOOOOOOMM! Brookline is a sleeping giant, a ticketing time bomb. If the Summit Ave neighbors wake up one Friday morning at 6:28AM and come out of their homes pissed because they lost sleep due to our noise, they\u2019ll do one of two things. 1. Straight up fight us for waking them up. PLEASE don\u2019t let this happen. I know about 350 of you mixed into the crowd are technically ninjas ([#BostonNinjaRace](http://boston.cbslocal.com/2013/01/23/despite-warnings-runners-head-outdoors-in-boston/)) but we\u2019d rather let the grumpy grumps get their well deserved 32 minutes of Z\u2019s then have to sort it out over some [ninja rap](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFLGRidfFo4). 2. The only other thing that could happen would be that they jump in and join the November Project! How awesome would that be!? Summit Ave full of neighbors meeting one another while running hill repeats in their pajamas!? Here is what I suggest: When you\u2019re LEAVING the workout, your office, or heading to or from ANYWHERE else in your life, approach the friendly, and even SLIGHTLY un-friendly looking people and tell them about your tribe. Recruiting via word of mouth is key and we will always need your help with this. If you have even one more person to chase through decks, up stairs, and over hills, you\u2019d be faster/fitter for it. \n\n**SUNDAY**: We\u2019ll be one week away from our 2013 Spring race called [#EasterHashHunt](http://november-project.com/easterhashhunt-by-november-project/). Please see details and RSVP [here](http://november-project.com/easterhashhunt-by-november-project/) so we\u2019ll know you\u2019re coming.

The focus will be on your November Project tribe, most specifically, the stadium workout next [Wednesday](http://november-project.com/stadium/), March 20th and the [HILLS next Friday](http://november-project.com/summit-ave/), March 22nd. They need each of us that will be a part of these workouts to sign a waiver\u2026 yeah, pretty official right? Feelin\u2019 the corporate blanket heavy on your face? Not us! We have to remind you, New Balance has been a supporter since the middle of last summer. They come out and train their asses off. They are fully painted members of November Project. We believe in NB the same way we believe in [88acres](http://88-acres.com/), [Geekhouse Bicycles](http://www.geekhousebikes.com/about/), [Back Bay Yoga](http://www.backbayyoga.com/Teachers), [Harpoon Brewery](http://www.harpoonbrewery.com/about) and the countless other local businesses that help us build your NP community. This month many of you will earn new kicks from NB\u2026 I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re easy to love.\n\nThese simple waivers will be passed out at the end of the workout tomorrow and will be collected before we begin on [WEDNESDAY](http://november-project.com/stadium/) next week. They won\u2019t ask for a hair sample, urine, or a retina scan\u2026 I think. If we have newbies (we always do) or if you forget to fill out and bring your signed sheet (BG), we\u2019ll have extra copies on site and can set you up BEFORE the workout. Not interested in personal and tribal fame? Totally cool. We\u2019ll just have you start the workout without the group to love, support, and power-hype you. We know New Balance is looking to capture the local mob that we\u2019ve built. They want to promote what we\u2019re doing and highlight how great Boston is. Exciting would be an understatement. If you can\u2019t tell, we\u2019re fucking jazzed. \n\n**YEARBOOK PHOTOS**: I\u2019ve wanted to put together for some time now. It will be a simple FB album of all of the faces of November Project taken head on. Posed in your choice of \u201cJC Penny super smiles\u201d or \u201cbadass mugshots,\u201d this album will be an ongoing project that will keep us even MORE connected to those we train side by side with at NP in the morning. For many of you who wake up 20% of the way through your workout we\u2019d like to warn you: The photos will be take BEFORE the workout after you hand over your signed waiver. Come lookin\u2019 sleepy, come dripping with sexual appeal, just come ready to train after your YEARBOOK PHOTO has be taken. Wednesday, March 20th, you\u2019ll hand your waiver to someone official (most likely me), then step into line to get your headshot taken, then you\u2019ll gather to hear the workout plan of attack. \n\n**RECAP**: Tomorrow we\u2019ll pass you something to sign and date, you\u2019ll bring it a week later, you\u2019ll get your YEARBOOK PHOTO taken ([#Grassroots](http://november-project.com/grassrootsgear-video/)?

Some of our members are pulling their least favorite v-neck out of the bottom layer of the laundry basket (Bojan), while others are ripping off tags from brand new Lulu gear (Above: [Esther Lofgren](http://www.usrowing.org/Pressbox/AthleteBios/EstherLofgren.aspx) (USA), 2012 London Olympic Gold Medalist). Our core members recall last August as we made a large push for a certain [Grassroots Gear Day at Harvard Stadium](http://november-project.com/grassrootsgear-video/). The workout/paint-fest was a celebration and brought the name **November Project** to life in all corners of Boston. These shirts were earned by participation. Each piece of gear could be seen around town and showed that members belief in bettering community, training with consistency, racing towards fitness, and that badass athletics **can** exist outdoors all 12 months of the year. With our very consistant NP members from New Balance shooting some Verry Chad, I mean, very real photography & even real\u2019er video the week of March 18th, we\u2019d hope you get YOUR #GrassrootsGear tagged up next Wednesday so you\u2019re ready to look legit. If any of you are not interested in being photographed while training with November Project\u2026 well\u2026 you may be in trouble. More details to come. \n\n**WISCONSIN NOTES**:  \n26 People.  \nNames/Scores\u2026coming soon.\n\nBoston crowd: \n", "title": "Wisconsin SNOW w/Dogs, Boston RAIN w/Wind, & Spreading The FREE Fitness MOVEMENT w/ Grassroots Gear @Nov_Project", "url": "http://november-project.com/wisconsin-snow-wdogs-boston-rain-wwind-spreading-the-free-fitness-movement-w-grassroots-gear-nov_project/", "workout_entry": true, "author": "brogan", "location": "POINT (-71.0635000000000048 42.3581000000000003)", "date": "2013-03-06", "dow": 2}, "model": "novproj.post", "pk": 208}, {"fields": {"body": "It\u2019s important to know the language used here at November Project if you\u2019re planning to train with, or even follow, what we\u2019re up to each week. Here is a short list of termnology we use at November Project that will help you make sense of it all. Enjoy.\n\n!. **\u201c#DestinationDeck\u201d** A simple hashtag term used to label our [Monday workout](http://november-project.com/destination-deck/). \n\n2\\. \u201c**We Missed You**\u201d is a section of the NP website. If you glance to the top of the page you\u2019ll see the tab\u2026 go ahead click on it. It will give you the play by play for those November Project members who didn\u2019t show up after dropping a \u201cverbal\u201d (see below for definition). Katie Deans is an example of [one of our best entries](http://november-project.com/katie-deans-wtf/). \n\n3\\. **\u201cVerbal.\u201d** Meaning, a verbal commitment to attend a future workout. Most commonly done via word-of-mouth, verbals can also be \u201cdropped\u201d online, through text message, or on a hand written love note. Giving a verbal is like swearing on all graves covered in holy scriptures and future loved children and grandchildren that you\u2019ll attend. Do the right thing, don\u2019t break a verbal. Ever. Someone says, \u201cYeah, I think I\u2019ll check out November Project this week.\u201d You can force them by saying, \u201cIs that a verbal?\u201d Then show them the [We Missed You](http://november-project.com/category/we-missed-you/) section. This is \u201chunting\u201d or \u201cfishing\u201d for a verbal. Gaining a large number of verbals at the same time using this technique\u2026 \n\n4\\. **\u201cVerbal Harvest\u201d**: Finding a large group in person or on the world wide web and asking which of them are planning on coming to the next morning session/workout. Pushing people to drop verbals is one thing that the NP leaders in both Boston and Madison do well. \n\n5\\. **\u201cPR Pizza\u201d**. Race your booty off on the last [Wednesday](http://november-project.com/stadium/) of each month, post your personal fastest time, and you\u2019ll win a pizza shaped trophy. It\u2019s a pizza. Kinda like BOOK IT back in the day\u2026 but less books. \n\n6\\. **\u201cSpice\u201d** is any small change or addition to a workout that will make the work more fun, harder, more interesting, or all of the above. \n\n7\\. \u201c**Stealing Wireless**,\u201d is the tern we use for the folks who come to train with us but start an annoying amount early or late so that \u201cthey don\u2019t have to deal with the large group.\u201d This isn\u2019t really playing fair because they\u2019re essentially soaking up the vibe and personal drive out of bed without doing the NP workout or making new friends the way we do. If people want less of a group they should train where we train on Tuesday, Thursday, & Saturday at 6:30AM. Boom! \n\n8.**\u201cAndrew Schwartz\u2019d\u201d**: In a carpooling situation, you offer the group your 4 available seats in your ride. The first person jumps in the back seat. When no other passengers load into this car because they\u2019re all in other cars there is a choice to make. Does this passenger get in front to politely keep the driver company? Or does this passenger take a ride from the back seat in a taxi cab style? If the passenger doesn\u2019t move and remains in the back seat for the duration of your awkward ride as you drive them to the destination\u2026 You\u2019ve just been Andrew Schwartz\u2019d. \n\n9\\. **\u201cMr.Birdman.\u201d** A group game that can be played at all times in all locations of this world. Put on the Mr. Birdman goggles and catch eye contact with other members. If they look into your eyes they must lay down on the ground for 5 seconds no matter where they\u2019re standing. \n\n10\\. **\u201cRecruiting Papers\u201d** are hand cut, circular pieces of discarded cardboard that simply read \u201cFUCK YEAH NOVEMBER PROJECT\u201d on them. They also have our website information and are handed out to only the nicest, fittest/fattest, and most fun people we run into here in Boston. I may hand you one at the end of your workout and tell you to bring one **new** person this week after giving them the info. Recruiting Papers. Make each one count. \n\n11\\. The **\u201cEaster Hash Hunt\u201d**: The November Project [spring race](http://november-project.com/easterhashhunt-by-november-project/) that will make most people in Boston a little nervous. Like everything else we do, it will be outdoors, fun as heck, and 100% FREE. Easter Hash Hunt is the best thing since [racing shopping carts](http://www.boston.com/yourtown/boston/fenway-kenmore/2013/03/03/boston-urban-iditarod/on4hi5fYoNMtORjrmbQlmL/pictures.html?pg=3). \n\n12\\. [Sebastians](http://november-project.com/when-life-gives-you-sandy-you-do-a-sebastian/): 7 minutes of all out burpies. We did this workout during the hurricane in the fall. Break 100 and you\u2019re moving pretty quick. \n\n13\\. [Bojans](http://november-project.com/heathen-yeti-racer-or-simply-bojan/): When you and a partner duck, crawl, down-dog, and FLY OVER one another. \n\n14\\. The [Positivity Award](http://november-project.com/positivity-award-nov_project/): At almost every single workout you\u2019ll see the weathered oar handle from Northeastern Rowing. This award is handed to a NP member who drives the group with their positivity. \n\n15\\. \u201c[#deckaday](http://november-project.com/4-city-october-challenge-a-deck-a-day-deckaday/)\u201d is an online check-in during the month of October of 2013. The phrase reffers to the commitment to become fitter in the core by doing a deck of cards every single day [throughout the month](http://november-project.com/4-city-october-challenge-a-deck-a-day-deckaday/).\n\n15B. \u201c[#deckaday](http://november-project.com/4-city-october-challenge-a-deck-a-day-deckaday/) tourist\u201d is the person who drops in on a good amount of the opening decks in a certain month and then fades in and out of his or her commitment. This person is weak when it comes to sticking a schedule but, if they play it right, this can also be pretty funny. This kind of person is usually not seen as badass at all. \n\n16\\. **\u201cFighter Jet\u201d** is a person, not a real jet, and from all we know, not a huge fighter. His real name is FJ and he is in charge of the Sunday social/training group called Boston Brunch Runners. You\u2019ll see \u201cFighter Jet\u201d at almost every single workout we host. Find and LIKE [Boston Brunch Runners on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/groups/211088912360485/?fref=ts). They\u2019re strong. They\u2019re fun. They\u2019re lead by a Fighter Jet. \n\n17\\. **\u201cMorning Person\u201d**: As in, \u201cI\u2019m not a morning person.\u201d The facts are simple, they don\u2019t exist. We\u2019re not morning people. No one is. Just wake up and stop talking about reasons you have to lay in bed and grow your gut. Boom. \n\n17B-D. \u201c[November Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_Project),\u201d dude, just check out [Wiki Page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_Project)! \n\n18\\. **\u201cFUCK YEAH!\u201d**: This is the only answer option when anyone from your November Project tribe asks if you\u2019re good. As in, \u201cYou good?\u201d Without getting into how tired you are or now busy things are at work, you decide to cut through the shit and respond with, \u201cFuck Yeah!\u201d\n\nHave a great day!

DG is also looking to award those of you who are doing the most recruiting. If you find yourself considering coming out in March, **now is the time**.

Our Spring event/race is here! \r\n\r\n**WHAT**: The Easter Hash Hunt or #EasterHashHunt is a group hunt/race where a few nimble group leaders are sent out just minutes in front of the giant pack of the rest of us. They race/lead a course that only they know and will lead everyone else to a final location. Along the way these leaders, better known as \u201chashers,\u201d will \u201chash\u201d their path using sidewalk chalk to guide the rest of the group that is hot on their heels. The idea is to attempt to reel in and possibly catch these \u201chashers\u201d before the milage wraps up.

Also highly suggested, recommended, and supported is a full body of pastel colors. Feel free to rip, paint, twist, tuck, and power bomb these outfits to mock all of those Nantucket wannabes on this very pastel driven day. **BUNNY EARS & PASTELS**. #GrassrootsGear is always a plus. \r\n\r\n**PARTY**: Brunch and beers will take place right at the finish line. Where is the finish line? You\u2019ll have to join the fun to find out. The \u201chashers\u201d will lead you there. \r\n\r\n**RSVP**: This is a bibless event.

Also, you should wear your coolest shit (#GrassrootsGear) because Boston Magazine is going to be there shooting for an article that will hype you, NP, and our upcoming #EasterHashHunt, but we\u2019ll get to that in a second. \n\n**FRIDAY**: Back on Summit Ave for some FULL HILLS. How many? Well you\u2019ll have to come and join us to find out. Just know that there will be small teams and tons of interactions. \u201cBut what are we training for?\u201d many of you may find yourself asking. Well, some of us are working up to next weekend\u2019s huge race in [Hyannis](http://www.hyannismarathon.com/) while others are looking to the [Boston Marathon](http://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon.aspx). As a group we should be looking at the same Sunday in March\u2026 one that will break ground the way the #BostonNinjaRace did. Our November Project spring race is finally here!\n\n**#EasterHashHunt by November Project** will take place on Easter Sunday, March 31st at 11AM. The hunt format will give racers two distinct routes that they can follow (4-5 miles, 8-10 miles). Being a Sunday, we\u2019ve already gotten the OK from FJ and the Brunch Runners crew to have a race/social open to all NP\u2019ers, Brunch\u2019ers, and those who still live on the outside. This FREE event will meet outside the Park Street MBTA station just before 11AM. All runners will be asked to wear the appropriate racing gear (rabbit or bunny ears & pastel colored clothing). Like the #BostonNinjaRace, all racers should be prepared to make history while being \u201crespectfully disruptive.\u201d Full details will be coming soon. Consider this your \u201csave the date\u201d for the spring race. Not around? Begin to tell the many people around you about what we\u2019re up to.

Somewhere between 50 and 1 billion members of the one and only November Project (Boston) made their way down to the Government Center MBTA station at 6:20AM. Many of them trimmed down their outfits and headed into the sea of sign holding, coffee cuffing, regular scarf & bag outfit wearing, and far from outgoing, Bostonians who were interested in being on television sets all over the United States Of America. November Project didn\u2019t need to be in the first, second, or even fifth row to totally own the scene. The two extremely famous hosts of the TODAY SHOW, Gretchen Television & Tim CouchAnkles were both their in person with the giant camera booms, full crew, and lights that made our usually gritty Faneuil Hall cobble stones of shine like gems. \n\nThe big question is\u2026 Did we get on TV? Were we able to show the whole country that November Project is having the most fun, getting fit, and building community that can\u2019t be beat for $0!? I\u2019ll have to answer these questions with a question: Who\u2019s cares if we were on TV? We are leading a movement that will eventually take over the whole country anyway. #TRUTH \n\nThe workout was a full warmup that went right into a 30 minute circuit. Each minute of work was broken into 40 seconds **ON** and 20 seconds **OFF** and then switched to a new motion. We rotated through our five motions six times which, if you do the math, adds up to the 30 minutes total (burpies, planks, pushups, mountain climbers, squat jumps). \n\n[MONDAY\u2019S #DestinationDeck](http://november-project.com/destination-deck/) will be held at [Children\u2019s Wharf Park](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Children's+Wharf+Park,+Boston,+MA+02210&ie=UTF-8&ei=fl8eUaK4H-be0QHb5YHoAw&ved=0CAsQ_AUoAg).

The suggestion has been brought up many times to head down and make a scene. After much debate, here is the plan: **This Friday** we\u2019ll meet at the Government Center T stop at 6:20AM sharp (run there). Once there, we\u2019ll strip down to shorts, #GrassrootsGear T\u2019s, shades, and whatever else will help bring on the warm weather and jog as a group down to Faneuil Hall. We\u2019ll do a 30 min circuit that will land us on the show and send the message of FREE FITNESS & BETTER COMMUNITY to the whole country. It\u2019s Friday, let\u2019s get a little weird.

Wear your [#GrassrootsGear](http://november-project.com/grassrootsgear/) for the photo opportunity before, during, and after the workout. We\u2019re hoping to have two amazing photo albums to show for each option come Monday/Tuesday. \n\n**MONDAY OPTION #2**: November Project [Yoga](http://november-project.com/37-337-membersonlyyoga/) is back (NP_Yoga3). Our location this time is [Back Bay Yoga Studio](https://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF-8&q=back+bay+yoga&fb=1&gl=us&hq=back+bay+yoga&hnear=back+bay+yoga&cid=0,0,8998873179903313275&ei=Im35UO_gJ4j00QGI1YCwBg&ved=0CJUBEPwSMAA) and the instructor is [Aaron Cantor](http://www.backbayyoga.com/Teachers).

Just jump on this registration link, must wear [#GrassrootsGear](http://november-project.com/grassrootsgear/) (so we know you\u2019re NP legit), and plan for some weird, fun, and very MONKEY type movements. This class, like everything else we do, is FREE for NP (no newbies). Please plan to arrive no later than 6:15AM. Remove your shoes and sign in on the second floor. Then head up to the 4th for something new. \n\nNo matter which option you take, we hope that you go with one that will push you AND take you out of your comfort zone. Feeling weak on the hills and you\u2019re already a Back Bay Yoga regular? Head to the Ninja Hill to get even faster. What\u2019s that? You\u2019ve never even tried yoga before and are interested in what that will look/feel like? Register quickly to grab one of 60 open spots. Don\u2019t get in the first 60 to register and don\u2019t want to run hills?

She, **Whitney Kemp**, is in all pods of this giant community that we\u2019ve built. She, **Whitney Kemp**, is today\u2019s [#PositivityAward](http://november-project.com/positivity-award-nov_project/) recipient. \n\nIts been awesome to see Whitney find new friends and PR\u2019s every month along the way at November Project.

We have always and will always encourage the classic FUCK YEAH\u2018s and the loud verbal encouragement in all of our workouts as long as they\u2019re not going to cause a problem with Officer Brother & the Brookline PD. So this Friday (and all Friday\u2019s from here on out) we will #JoinHands, hug it out, breakdown the work ahead of us, run the hill, and gather after the workout to pass on the #PositivityAward.

As you\u2019re arriving, training, and pushing through the workout PLEASE keep your volume at the most MUTE level possible.\n\nWe need to be clear about this because we DO joke around a lot: We are going back to Summit Ave to train as a tribe because we have already shown that we can show up with 200+ members without making a sound. After last week\u2019s $100 fine (I really appreciate everyone pitching in cash to pay for it) that was written in my name, I\u2019m putting trust in you all that we can train smarter and remain in that location. The next fine is $300; the following is a court appearance\u2026 you get the point.\n\nThanks to those NP members who chipped in cash to make this go away quickly. \n\nThanks to those NP members who chipped in cash to make this go away quickly. \n\nSo here is our pledge: We will not make a single noise of any kind during the workout and we\u2019ll do 100% of the running on the sidewalks of Summit Ave. This workout will be called #TakeOn. We did it before! Does anyone remember [#HillsBySafetyNinjas1](<a href=)?\n\nAs an addition to staying stealthy on Friday, the Serbian Co-Founder (Bojan) will be spreading fliers up and down our running course tomorrow (Thursday) at 7PM announcing our presence and apologizing for any past noise disturbances. He\u2019ll be at the park at the top of the hill at 7PM ready to go.

Because this is the month when you start acting like you need a gym membership **or** its \u201cjust too cold to be outside\u201d seems to want to come out of your usually badass mouth **or** you just don\u2019t have \u201cthe right gear\u201d. With the holidays swarming around us and binge eating season in full swing, November is important month to set your positive workout/training patterns. Yes, this is the time of year to say, \u201c**I will not miss a single workout so that I can set my own pattern and I WILL blast through the entire winter without missing a beat**.\u201d Yes folks, that is the foundation to pushing through the colder months \u2013 set a pattern now. Drop your verbals. What about a full month long verbal? Badass? We like to think so. Try it. \r\n\r\nHere is the deal, our friends from [PUMA](http://www.shop.puma.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-US-Site/en_US/Home-Show) (don\u2019t worry, they have local roots and train with our tribe already) are going to commemorate the month of November by awarding our members a weekly gear gift that will add up to what we\u2019re calling the #NP_WinterKit by PUMA. Once a week, **every** member at a selected workout will be awarded the warm weather piece to what will add up to a full kit by the time December rolls around. \r\n\r\nGloves? Hats? Layers? Even jackets? Yes, it is going to be awesome. Here\u2019s what makes #PUMA.Power even cooler: You will not know which workout of the week you\u2019ll see these awards. You could show up on a WEDNESDAY at Harvard Stadium and see that everyone who completes the workout that morning is getting hooked up\u2026 but you won\u2019t know until you get there. For those of you who \u201conly go on WEDNESDAY.\u201d This will give you even more of a reason to try all three workouts each week. PUMA & November Project\u2122 could decide to award only #DestinationDecks this month. It could happen. You\u2019ll just have to show up to **everything** if you\u2019re interested in the full package. \r\n\r\nSo\u2026 Why is the month of November so important? Because if you don\u2019t miss a sigle workout this month you will end up with the #NP_WinterKit. So\u2026 NOW what are your friends who are still on the fence joining NP going to say? #RecruitMoreRacers, #Rise&Shine, and you\u2019ll feel the #PUMA.Power with your #NP_WinterKit @Nov_Project. \r\n\r\nPS: Thanksgiving week we\u2019ll have our only official workout on Monday so that we aren\u2019t too spit up by those who travel.

You\u2019ll be expected to let us know within 48 hours if you can\u2019t make it so we can pass your RSVP\u2019d space on to the first on our waiting list. If you\u2019re planing on going out the night before we highly recommend that you pass on this RSVP. Goldie\u2019s classes are far from easy and no-shows/late-shows are not OK. With that said, this is the perfect chance to get in some yoga by the Best Of Boston 2012.

Nope! \u201cF\u201d is for FAIL and that would be an \u201cF\u201d! Now, if you can snap a photo a in the [Whole Foods parking lot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UFc1pr2yUU)? NICE! Inside a food truck\u2019s kitchen at the Farmer\u2019s Market? GREAT. What about your office with the secretary named Sue or Ronda or Sherry? Perfect! Old Folks Home? Check. Driving bumper cars? Using jumper cables? Playing UNO? Eating at UNO\u2019s?! Waiting tables at UNO\u2019s!? Now you\u2019re getting the idea. Be creative and represent November Project without ending up in jail. We can\u2019t bail you out but will stop by and pick up your shirt. #ShirtlessInJail #BadSituation #BeenThere \n\nEnjoy your weekend.

You\u2019ll need to break through these voices and make SHOWING UP your first test of the day \u2013 the workout will be the easy part after that. As the sun came up in other parts of the East Coast, our cheering and hollering could be heard echoing off the stone walls of the drenched stadium there in Lower Allston. It was very real. It was a total blast. \n\n**MOVING FORWARD**  \nWe\u2019ll say it clearly right now so there is no confusion down the line: **We train in all conditions. We will be outside. We are going to have the workout no matter what!** And because of these statements we are allowed to call ourselves #weatherproof and know that the tribe will be there #RainOrShine. Bojan and I did this every single day last winter while much of Boston took it to treadmills and [Thighmasters](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkxFWVGqUCg).

For those of you who completed the full workout (FrogMan1) you should be proud. 40 and 30 sections completed? Keep working towards that 50 section mark. Today you should make sure to stay on top of your healthy diet and consistant hydration. \n\n**FRIDAY**  \nAs usual, we are meeting at the park on the **TOP** of [Summit Ave hill in Brookline](/summit-ave/).

It\u2019s very simple and, in true November Project style, you have a due date: Between now and our #DestinationDeck, Monday at 6:30AM, your homework is to let November Project know of your proudest workout or moment in motion. Essentially, what will you do this weekend that you want to share with the group? Take photos, give us your result, tell us about your team, or just give us a one liner about. Two rules: You can only highlight one workout/activity. You must post to the NP Facebook wall before the due date. No Tweets.\n\nThis homework is designed to have our members see into the active lives outside of the MON, WED, FRI routine and we\u2019d all love to further connect through this #grassroots #community driven tribe. Think of this as more of a show and tell, rather than a \u201cwho did the most badass workout. If you don\u2019t submit your homework by Monday at 6:30am you\u2019ll have to do 1 minute long plank on each ace in the deck _after_ you complete 14 sit-ups or pushups.\n\nAgain, great work to those of you who PR\u2019d in the hills.

Now, before my wife starts getting mad about me saying that a workout day trumps our wedding day, honeymoon, and many other best days ever that we had during our wonderful 3.5 years of marriage, I want to add a disclaimer that today was the best day in the short history of November Project. Three and a half months ago [we opened this workout group to the public](/november-project-open-to-public/) with 4 people (including 2 Co-Founders) and we\u2019ve grown to 175+ attendees that showed up today. Let me repeat that\u2026 **in three and a half months we went from 4 to 175+ people running the stadium on Wednesdays**. It\u2019s all thanks to you, the NP tribe that\u2019s been nonstop #RecruitingMoreRacers, talking about NP at work, and random folks on the street. We wouldn\u2019t be able to do it without it you.\n\nBut our \u201cThe Best Day Ever\u201d statement is not all about the attendance numbers. Today the overall energy felt different. It seemed like we had extra hop in our step, it seemed like we were running faster, doing more sections\u2026 We even had more people sticking around for the group shot even though we know that you need to be at work/school/class. We had wonderful group of humans showing up to do their workout early so they can help with #GrassrootsGear production. Some folks came to help out as soon as their workout was over. Massive thanks to everyone \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t be able to pull it off without you!\n\nOne would attribute the energy to the beautiful weather, or the #GrassrootsGear hype, or the large attendance, which are all playing significant part. But we think that our tribe finally developed a sense of strong community that supports and pushes each other while getting stronger, faster, healthier. So keep #RecruitingMoreRacers, continue spreading the good word, and proudly showcase your new official NP apparel at your next workout, race, BBQ or a black-tie event.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t catch this energy thing at all, it\u2019s possible that we\u2019re just high from inhaling spray paint for 30 minutes straight in which case completely ignore previous 3 paragraphs.

By day Rube drives sales and builds corporate accounts at Olympia and no longer runs piano boxes up and down stairs \u2013 though he retains those skills. After work Rube can build you a custome bicycle, tell you some jokes, date your ex-girlfriend, and remember your mom\u2019s name, all with beer in hand.

If you don\u2019t have a watch to track your time and are calling your score based on the position of the sun, no time with Phoebe.

Just don\u2019t tell him that he\u2019ll meet Phoebe, he\u2019ll get to do that only AFTER he posts a PR. \n\nOn Wednesday, we are also painting t-shirts. But we\u2019re going oldschool.

This dude is a soft spoken racer that comes up with brilliant ideas [around the Boston Marathon](http://november-project.com/the-week-of-insanity-bos-nola/#paryan). Recently he decided to share his story of how November Project helped him embrace Boston as his home away from home._\n\nAs I approach my 30th birthday next month, I\u2019ve begun to reflect a bit on what has gotten me to this point, and January 15th, 2014 was probably one of the most important days of the last decade for me.\n\nBut before I get there, I need to set the scene, and take this story back to November 2011, when I took a job in the Boston area. This meant moving away from my family, friends, and known surroundings of New Jersey, and relocate to a city I knew nothing about and knew almost know one there. I made the choice for personal and professional reasons, and had hoped to push myself out of my comfort zone.\n\nI moved into my apartment in early January 2012. I quickly learned it was almost impossible to make friends when it\u2019s 20 degrees outside. I began to immediately doubt if this was the right decision.\n\nFlash forward to April 2013. One of my sisters and my father had come into town to watch their first Boston Marathon. We had been standing on Commonwealth Ave, at the top of the Mass Ave underpass, right before the turn onto Hereford for the better part of the day. We had left just after 2pm to get lunch. It was a great day\u2026 until 2:49pm. This moment is the exact point I began to fall into a deep \u201cmental funk\u201d that would grow over the next nine months.\n\nAs I sat on my couch that Monday evening, I could say nothing. At that moment, I was unsure what was to come, if I would stay in Boston, or if my dream of running the Boston Marathon was over. For the next several weeks I found myself going to Boylston every day to pay respect at the makeshift memorials and be around other people. One of the events I ended up at was the One Run Boston final mile on May 25th. This was my introduction to November Project, but I wouldn\u2019t realize it at the time. \n\nI remember seeing people with spray painted shirts and jackets, and thinking how bizarre that was. I was speaking to someone in a yellow marathon volunteer jacket with the tag on it, and I didn\u2019t really understand exactly what they were trying to sell. \u201cYou run stairs at Harvard Stadium? I\u2019m a runner, I would never do that!\u201d I said to them. I moved on from that moment not to think of November Project again. The rest of 2013 was filled with highs and lows. I fell into the worst of my \u201cfunk\u201d while back in NJ for the holidays. I became homesick and was completely ready to give up on Boston. I contemplated what I would be giving up if I just decided to up and quit, and move back home.\n\nI soon came to the realization that giving up wasn\u2019t an option. I returned to Boston the next day, resolved to be better. It didn\u2019t work. I continued to struggle with my place in the world, and what I was doing with my life. I lacked the support around me to really want to change.\n\nAs luck would have it, one day the following week, while running my zillionth treadmill workout of the winter, there happened to be a copy of the December 2013 Runner\u2019s World on the ground next to me. I had vaguely recognized the November Project tag on the shirt of one of the runners on the cover from the prior May encounter. I ended up \u201cborrowing\u201d the magazine and bringing it home. I read the article, still wasn\u2019t completely sure what this whole community thing was all about, but committed to checking it out once. I mean if it\u2019s in a reputable magazine like Runner\u2019s World, maybe it isn\u2019t so bad!\n\nI showed up the following Wednesday on January 15th at Harvard Stadium at 6:25 in the morning. I rarely got out of bed before 7:45, and for this I was up at 5:30 to run stairs in 20 degree weather?!? I was already turned off to the whole idea, but continued on for the purposes of at least saying to myself \u201cI tried it, but it wasn\u2019t for me\u201d. \n\nI proceeded to bounce for the first time, awkwardly hugged a few strangers with my crotch pointed out, and then went to the newbie meeting. I, like so many other newbies, didn\u2019t heed the warning to take it somewhat easy the first day and I bonked, big time. I was shocked. Here I was, in what I thought was good shape, and I was getting whooped by young and old, tall and short alike. But it was memorable, and as I sat for the group photo, I began to understand that this was what I needed two years ago. This is how you make friends in 20 degree weather in Boston in January! \n\nSee six months ago this past week is the exact moment my life took a turn for the better. It hasn\u2019t just made me physically stronger, but it has made me mentally stronger. My whole philosophy has changed because of November Project. I no longer say no, or I can\u2019t to ideas. I push myself to get out of my comfort zone, and most importantly, I #justshowup every week. I never know exactly what the day\u2019s workout will entail, but I know along the way, I\u2019ve gained a collection of me doing absolutely ridiculous things at 6:45 in the morning. And I love every one of them:\n\nTo my tribe mates (and BG & Bojan in particular), I say thank you! The tribe makes my life better and encourages me to make others\u2019 lives better as well. I find myself doing this bizarre thing when I see strangers on the street. I smile at them, and I don\u2019t really know why, it just feels right now.\n\nI often catch myself telling to people I wish I had found November Project sooner. But I can\u2019t change my start date. So if you are reading this, and haven\u2019t joined us yet, I ask why not? Make this coming week be that moment for you, where your life gets even better. #justshowup!\n", "title": "From Mental Funk to Cartwheels", "url": "http://november-project.com/from-mental-funk-to-cartwheels/", "workout_entry": true, "author": "bojan", "location": "POINT (-71.0635000000000048 42.3581000000000003)", "date": "2014-07-22", "dow": 1}, "model": "novproj.post", "pk": 323}, {"fields": {"body": "There are few no-bullshit-result workouts that I really enjoy. Before I list them all I\u2019ll explain what a no-bullshit-result workout is. It is the workout that you can\u2019t fake your performance or a result by using your athletic background. Stick with me here for a second\u2026\n\nMy athletic background is rowing. If I was to walk into any crossfit gym, or the box as the folks in the industry call them, and challenge their strongest guy or a gal (without rowing experience) to a 2000m challenge on a rowing machine, I\u2019m confident that I would win in over 95% of cases. And yes, I am taking into consideration the fact that the last time I rowed was two years ago. So why am I so confident (cocky)? Because I know how to row efficiently. I did it for half of my life and the movement is so engraved in my muscle memory that even though I haven\u2019t done it in so long I would still beat folks that may be in better shape that I am. I call that a bullshit result. \n\nBullshit result doesn\u2019t paint the real image as it gives people advantage based on their athletic background. It\u2019s like trying to debate who\u2019s the best athlete of all times. It\u2019s impossible to say. Michael Jordan back in his day was THE MAN on the basketball court. He tried to play baseball and sucked big time. If he tried to get on the bike and climb some serious mountains he would fail miserably. You can\u2019t compare apples and oranges, unless you\u2019re comparing which you like better. But then you\u2019re forming a subjective opinion. I\u2019m going off tangent here\u2026 \n\nYou\u2019re probably wondering what are the no-bullshit-result workouts. Those are the workouts where the playing field is so leveled that folks from ALL athletic backgrounds and fitness levels will be humbled. Best example: running stadium steps. You may be a marathoner, a sprinter, a cyclist, a weigh lifter\u2026 you will suffer the same unless you\u2019re using stair running in your training. \n\nAnther example of a no-bullshit-result workout? Sebastians. You may be really good at doing pushups, or can do a perfect plank for hours, but unless you can do it all mixed in with jumps, as a burpee, over the period of 7 minutes, you will suffer. You may have a great stamina, strong legs, and can run and ride for hours, but if your upper body gets tired after trying to peel yourself off the ground over and over, you will suffer. The point is, to do well at Sebastians you have to be a solid all around athlete. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with using your background as an advantage. I\u2019m just a big fan of reminding myself that there are still a lot of things that I need to work on. Take this morning for instance\u2026 After trying to keep up with Emily and Adrienne during 7 minutes of burpees, I realized that I have quite a few things to work on to improve my no-bullshit fitness. I also realized that hustling people on the rowing machine in the crossfit gyms is not okay. You live and you learn. \n\nOn Wednesday [bring a backpack filled with things](http://november-project.com/prepare-for-a-full-week-in-bos/#wed). \n", "title": "No Bullshit Workout (BOS)", "url": "http://november-project.com/no-bullshit-workout-bos/", "workout_entry": true, "author": "bojan", "location": "POINT (-71.1078080000000057 42.3580329999999989)", "date": "2014-07-21", "dow": 0}, "model": "novproj.post", "pk": 324}, {"fields": {"body": "[MONDAY](http://november-project.com/destination-deck/): Our legendary [#DestinationDeck](http://november-project.com/destination-deck/) will be gathering in a quiet residential area where we\u2019ll train just like ninjas and disappear just like\u2026 well, like Ninjas.

This September we\u2019re going to have the largest gathering of November Project members, co-leaders, and all around hype, that we\u2019ve ever had in our almost 3 years running. Save the date, build your team, get your hotel/camp-site, and make sure to be a part of this. The weekend will have many fun and easy pieces you could join up with and we\u2019d like to lay them all out so that you\u2019re able to, in the words of Bojan Mandaric, just fucking show up. \n\n**FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 12th, 6:30AM**: The second November Project tribe of all time will host their usual beatdown workout in their usual Friday location \u201con the square\u201d in Downtown Madison.

After the workout you\u2019ll have roughly 24 hours until your next physical activity so plan to discover Madison with your new friends from the workout.

Having Chicago, Milwaukee, Madison, and Minneapolis all within range, we should see a good showing from those tribes. With that said, how cool will it be to see the many NP logos on #GrassrootsGear before, during, and after the event from all over North America!? West Coast or East Coast? New Orleans or Edmonton? Who can show up in the largest/loudest way from each city?\n\nPlan ahead: Getting to the race is an hour drive (without traffic) and you\u2019ll want to be there for the painting, trash-talking, friendship building, and general nonsense which will begin roughly 90 minutes before the race goes off. Do the math here, leaving Madison by 8:30AM would be about right. \n\n**SATURDAY NIGHT**: Downtown Madison, the [Union Terrace](http://www.union.wisc.edu/venue-muterrace.htm), popcorn, ducks, beers, live music, fun, laughs, social times. Oh, and BG is going to make all of you swim once it gets late. He still thinks Madison is his hometown and that this is a good idea. Plan to get wet. \n\n**SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 14th**: Open. You\u2019ll eventually need to make your way back into your real life. Travel home.

It usually starts in the country that\u2019s bordering with France and ends in Paris. It\u2019s considered one of the most physically challenging races in the world as participants grind for 3 weeks through the weather conditions ranging from cold and rain to hot and sticky, while sitting on a 6 square inch saddle, riding three to five hours every day. Winning one stage is a BIG deal, winning the event makes the rider an instant legend. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that the sport of cycling has been associated with cheating and PEDs. I don\u2019t know much about the topic to publicly share my opinion but I truly believe that humans are capable of amazing things without cutting corners. You can call me a hopeless romantic or an idiot \u2013 in this case the line between the two is very thin and either terms could be used interchangeably. But to support my hypothesis, I\u2019ll use this morning\u2019s stage to argue that if you have the right mindset you can achieve great things. \n\nThe 96 mile stage from Ypres to Arenberg Porte du Hainaut was everything that purebred cyclists would despise. Rain. Slick roads. Narrow streets covered in cobble stones. Race-ending crashes. But one guy ceased the moment. His name is Lars Boom (great name) from Netherlands and his previous best finish at TDF was in 105th place. But he\u2019s not a nobody. To ride in Tour de France you can\u2019t be a nobody. Lars won bunch of races in his past, but he never won at TDF. He\u2019s not a purebred cyclist. He\u2019s a cyclocross rider. That means that his bread and butter are wooded roads, muddy trails, and wet surfaces that you sometimes have to [tackle off your bike](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yIE87T4_ERQ/TvS2_Mu1LcI/AAAAAAAAAbk/GdAHeofQ6lA/s1600/feedback%2B%2540%2Bcyclo%2Bx%2B2011%2B%252835%2529.jpg). So when bunch of skinny dudes with giant quads woke up this morning in Ypres, Belgium most of them were cursing the weather conditions. All those dudes had a miserable day. But not Lars. He woke up knowing that today is going to be a good day. He rode the race of his life, he put himself in contending position, and he won the stage in dominating fashion beating out guys that on the paper are better cyclist than he is. From this day on Lars Boom will be known as a guy that won one of [the most memorable stages of 2014 Tour de France](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/122886174). \n\nSo why am I telling you all this?  \nBecause next time you\u2019re looking for excuses in weather conditions, not enough sleep, hard week of training, just channel your inner Lars Boom and go out and kick some ass.

I took all these beautiful buildings for granted for so long \u2013 never really comprehending how majestic they are \u2013 never really taking time to capture them in a photo. So as I was going through the photos from this morning I came to the realization\u2026 Man, I really love Boston!\n\nSpecial thanks to our new friend Toni from who let us complete the workout at Christian Science Plaza even though we didn\u2019t ask for a permission. Toni, you\u2019re a nice lady and we promise to announce ourselves next time we\u2019re in the area. \n\nTomorrow, our yearbook photos from #NP17 will drop on the world and in the process will break facebook.

There I saw our friend Laura a.k.a. _DJ Phoenix_ pulling out her music-playing-and-mixing-setup out of her car. We recruited few members to help us bring all her gear from the car to the top of section 19 where she set up her makeshift and very professional DJ booth. It only took a little sneaking, crawling, hundreds of feet of sketchy extension cables and my new skill of circuit-throwing to add power to our DJ\u2019s setup\u2026 once I got down off the roof and returned to the tribe\u2026 yeah\u2026 We\u2019re still 10 minutes from the bounce. Stay with me. \n\nAt 5:30AM, with few hundred of my closest friends, I raced 37 sections as fast as I could. Result, a PR. Boom. Go me. \n\nAfter I caught my breath and got my legs back under me, I jogged from section 1 back to 37 to tag some early group Grassroots Gear shirts. There, I was accompanied by few injured members that, despite their injuries and inability to participate in the workout, decided to come out and help with the tagging process. \n\nAt 6:30AM I joined BG at the bottom of the section 37 where he started the bounce. The music was loud, the adrenalin was flowing, spirits were high, people were ready to crush some stairs. I started the first wave of racers at 6:35AM and continued with flights of 10-14 racers each 15-30 seconds for the next 15 minutes. Then I passed on the starting process to BG who was bringing in the newbies just in time to see the last group of \u201cbig kids\u201d start their race. I jogged over to the top of section 1 (finish line) where some of the faster cats were just about to wrap up their PR run. I looked at the bleachers above the section 1 and the Paint Crew was plowing through the 5:30AM group\u2019s pile of shirts. Seeing that they don\u2019t need my help I got into the cheering mode hoping that loud noises and F-bombs will help people run faster up the last section. \n\nDid it help? I don\u2019t know, but as people were whispering their scores to the time keepers while trying to catch their breath, I was able to her few that said \u201cThat\u2019s a PR\u201d! That line always puts the smile on my face. I always love that. \n\nAt 7:30AM, after singing some odd form of Happy Birthday and taking the group photo (which was the only photo I took this morning as our boy Scott Yellow was doing few rounds with his camera), I was ready to leave the stadium. But not until I helped DJ Phoenix break down her station. I asked few of the dudes that look like they can lift few pounds if they can help with the process, to which they replied the only appropriate answer \u201cFuck Yeah\u201d! \n\nAt 8:15AM, 3 hours after I got there, I was on my bike going home.\n\nBG\u2019s morning wasn\u2019t that much different: Between LIVE-time social media, leading the bounce, running the newbie meeting, petting the dogs, kissing the babies, cracking the jokes, he was running around like a wild man. When we got on our bikes to ride away from the stadium we both agreed that this morning was epic! \n\nBut why was it epic? We didn\u2019t do anything different from what we usually do. I made you read all the way down to the bottom of the page without revealing the secret sauce!? Well, if you were reading it carefully the secret sauce would kick you right in the face! \n\nRemember DJ Phoenix? The Paint Crew (Big20, FoulBall & Team Stencil-Gloves)? The time keepers, Scott\u2019s photos, all the people that helped out with moving things, and those who are always picking up trash? They **ARE** our secret sauce. Our secret sauce is Deniz, the Turkish Warrior of Peace & Kindness, who came today at 5:15AM to drop off his cooler of orange slices on the rocks, dashed out for a quick pool/pond workout, and came back at 6:30 to race his life away! Our secret sauce is the collection of people that help us with all of the little things that we would not be able to pull of on our own. Our secret sauce is the collection of leaders of the unstoppable 17 cities that are waking up at the crack of dawn three mornings a week and get paid in hugs and highfives. Our secret sauce is the two NP co-founder wives that provide unconditional love and support to everything that we do regardless of how silly it may appear. Usually people don\u2019t reveal their secret sauce because they\u2019re afraid that someone might steal it. We just gave you the sauce. Enjoy it, add to it, write about it, tag it, share it, whatever. \n\nWe had an amazing morning with more than a side of special sauce. \n\nThese are the times of the people that completed the full tour this morning. \n", "title": "What\u2019s The Secret Sauce?

I used to be one of those fans. The reason I\u2019m saying use to is because these days, my time spent watching sports usually involves the other football. You know the one where people wear pads, helmets, and touch the ball (or should I say the prolate spheroid), mostly with their hands. Except for those few times when that one guy can actually kick it!?!? Who ever decided that the name \u201cfootball\u201d was appropriate for that activity? I guess if I had to choose between spheroid-throwing-tackle-ball or football, I\u2019d also go with later option, but I digress. \n\nThese days due to lack of exposure to soccer in US, my connection with the sport boils down to some internet highlights and an occasional sportscenter mention. But every four years the World Cup rolls around and the soccer fire in my belly is rekindled. I watch the games between Columbia and Ivory Coast with the intentness and intensity as if the faith of the universe is being decided by the outcome of the match. I feel that the 10 man team from Greece defying constant attacks of their Japanese counterparts resulting in 0-0 draw is as exciting as the NBA slam dunk contest. And there are many fair-weather fans like me out there that come out only during the World Cup, or the European Championships, or the Champions League Finals, but they still appreciate the game and the craft just as much as the fans that go to every game, know every chant, or name their firstborn children after the captain of their local club. \n\nIn a sense, November Project members are little bit like soccer fans. There are the ones that come every Monday-Wednesday-Friday regardless of the weather conditions \u2013 these are your die-hards. And then there are the ones that come out only when the weather is nice and the shirts are off \u2013 these are your World-Cup-only-if-your-country-is-playing watchers and pretty much everyone in San Diego (xoxo to my NP_SD friends). \n\nBut regardless of how often we watch the game (#justshowup) our love for the sport (working out) and our fellow fans (tribesman/ladies) is undeniable.

It\u2019s 5:45am and I\u2019m wracked with nerves. The clouds looming overhead indicate that there is more to come. I\u2019ve been up since 3:30am going over the plan in my head. My shirt is already soaked to my skin. It\u2019s very much like an English summer\u2019s day at home.\n\nDeniz and I have been asked to be substitute leaders for Fridays November Project hills. Receiving the email my heart swelled and I puffed out my chest. Wow. What an honor. But then you realize whose shoes you\u2019ve been asked to fill. Bojan and Brogan. Two giants both physically and metaphorically. In their shoes my little boy\u2019s body will only fill a single toe.  \nI stand quietly, alone. My head runs over the plan again. The people of November Project (NPers) are my friends. More than that, they\u2019ve become almost family. I respect them and I hope they respect me. I seriously don\u2019t want to let them down. The rain keeps falling and I wonder if anyone will show up. \n\nPeople trickle in, dressed in their bright grassroots gear; the colors cheer me up and bring some vigor back to my being. The crowds swell in the park playground, the fact that two Europeans are taking the session and the weather hasn\u2019t put people off. Before Deniz and I know what\u2019s happening they surround us expecting\u2026 but what were they expecting\u2026  \nI make the runners squat so that Deniz and I can experience what it\u2019s like for Bojan and Brogan as they stand head and shoulders above the crowd. We get a bounce going on, we cheer the new comers, we whisper some \u2018Fuck Yeahs\u2019 as loud as possible. But it feels weird. We\u2019re not Brogan and Bojan, we\u2019re Deniz and Danny \u2013 two slightly quirky guys who thrive on being themselves. Always. So why was I here trying to be Brogan Graham? The legend that is. \n\nSo we scrap the plan and decide to put a bit of our own personality on the run. Deniz gets the runners massaging each other\u2019s calves, then we suggest they give an awkward British hug (shoulders turned in, slapping backs to say \u2018enough already\u2019, defo no pelvis touching, and none of that nasty energy giving). A buzz is starting to pass through the crowd\u2026 Taking advantage we set the runners off \u2013 running on the right side of the road. (What a shame we don\u2019t have such control of the drivers in America who seem determined to continue to drive on the wrong side of the road. It\u2019s just stupid.)\n\nI friggin love burpees and, seeing as it\u2019s Friday the 13th, it\u2019s decided that each runner will do 13 burpees after each hill. Unlucky for the runners. Lucky for Deniz and I who enjoy counting the burpees as people try to swear at us whilst gasping for breath.\n\nAfter 40 minutes of pain we all congregate, taking a picture with our shirts over our heads, celebrating the fact that the FOOTBALL World Cup is upon us. We then give the birthday girls, at the bottom of the hill, a single blood curdling \u2018BOOM\u2019 before running down the hill towards them and diving onto the wet muddy grass and sliding past them in a manner of the legendary German footballer, Jurgen Klinsmann, who, no doubt, none of you have heard of! \n\nThanks for being patient with your substitute leaders as we found ourselves!

Few months later, Molly is settled in the new place where she decided to put the pen to the paper and share her story. Ladies and gentleman, Molly Blumberg\u2026  \n_  \nI\u2019ve been trying to write this for a while now. It took me some time to get started \u2013 I had thought that waiting until I moved into my new apartment, giving myself some time and space, would offer the right perspective. I\u2019ve drafted my story a few times, but none of them felt quite right. I don\u2019t need to give all the specifics of my struggle to say what I really want to say to you all, which is simply, \u201cthank you.\u201d What I want to talk about, what I really learned over the past few months, is the strength of community, of caring and love, of support and resilience.\n\nBy now most of you know my story, or at least the most recent part of it. I went to work on a Thursday, my apartment caught fire around 2pm, and that was that. It was horrible, and upsetting, and unsettling, and it came with a whole set of issues I\u2019d never had to deal with before. The truth is, there were things that I was struggling with well before my apartment burnt down. And while I like to think of myself as a pretty resilient person, I was really in over my head. I\u2019m not good at asking for help \u2013 I had to enlist a chain of people in order to ask you all for help. I wanted to be able to take care of myself. I thought that the best way to come out on top was to shoulder this one alone. But I was running out of resources, running out of places to sleep, running out of options, and taking this one on solo was just not going to be my reality. Up until that point, I would have said that the greatest thing I had learned through November Project was that I can always push myself a little further. I can fight through the pain, run faster, climb higher, than I had ever thought that I could. But that\u2019s only the first half. I now know just how much further I can go with the help and support of community. I can still push myself pretty far on my own, but when I reach my end, there will be people, hundreds of people, who will selflessly, and without second thought, pick me up and carry me the rest of the way.\n\nIt\u2019s been said many times before \u2013 there\u2019s something truly special about November Project. There\u2019s something a little magical that drags us out of bed on even the darkest and coldest mornings. It\u2019s more than the workout, the challenge of running the Harvard stadium, the desire to get fitter and faster. It\u2019s more than the smiles, the hugs, the fuck yeahs. I feel like it even extends beyond the general idea of community. For me, I think it\u2019s about the fierce consistency and the unconditional dedication to showing up together, no matter what. We\u2019re there to work together, to get each other moving, to achieve new goals and to share in that glory. What got me out of bed all winter was knowing that there were hundreds of other people who held the same core belief in just showing up despite everything else. It was knowing that there are few things better than being present in such a passionate community and pushing your limits with your peers. It was knowing that I could drop all the shit I was dealing with, give some hugs, challenge myself, and walk away feeling like my character was a little stronger because of the people I shared that all with.\n\nFor a few weeks, not many of you knew that my apartment had burnt down and I was sleeping on couches. From some conversations I\u2019ve had with various members of the tribe and other stories that have been written, it\u2019s clear there are a lot of us out there dealing with a whole range of adversities. We don\u2019t always know everyone\u2019s story. I was personally lucky to be in a position to share mine and to receive the overwhelming support that I did. Regardless, for those few early hours in the morning, none of that matters, none of that defines us. We throw on our running shoes and we show up as equals, as supporters, as competitors, as racers, as empowerers. \n\nWe all have things that we carry with us \u2013 our unique combination of successes and struggles, our histories, our stories, our ambitions. We deal with these things and learn from them in different ways. Some of us carry them with us, or we set them aside, follow them, run from them. Everything we have experienced, the histories that precede us, the things we have yet to accomplish, all define the people we are, and they have led us to this place, this moment in time. But no matter where we are, or where we\u2019re going, what we carry, or what we\u2019ve learned, we all show up. At 6:30am on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays we all show up. We show up for ourselves and we show up for each other.

We were childhood friends who\u2019d shared our college years from many states away. Relating over the years as D1 athletes, we had now joined forces in our late 20\u2032s to take down a trail race we\u2019d signed up for after sharing a few pitchers in the West Village one night on one of my random visits to New York City. Nick, a former college soccer star at the University of Wisconsin who went on to play a handful of years professionally in Chicago, DC, and New Zealand was a great teammate. What made him a great friend at this time in my life is that he was _ALWAYS_ down to sign up for events. You name the race. You name the date. He\u2019s there. We signed up for the 4-man event with just the two of us and when race day came, prepared or not, we raced our hearts out to prove that we still had it. And on that day we had it! Nick took legs 1 and 3 and I took legs 2 and 4 of the 26.2 mile trail relay. [And we won](/cinco-de-redtube/)! Fuck yeah we won! We were pumped! When was the last time I\u2019d won a running race?! Never!? OK. In those same few weeks Bojan & I had been tweeting and blog posting about the November Project in Boston (back when we were meeting only one time per week with what we thought were amazing numbers \u2013 15-20 people)! \n\nFast forward two years and Bear Mountain is still standing strong, and November Project is in 16 cities across North America. With a few car loads of tribe men and women from Boston, New York City, and Washington D.C., we set out to out-fun, and maybe even out-run, the most social event of the weekend; The Marathon Relay (the same race from Bear Mt 2012). Coming off of a pretty long winter all of us were happy to see sunshine as we hit the green, lush, and overly muddy trails. We were also happy to have one another there to cheer on, trash talk, and push one another to the line. All sixteen cities in our four different timezones should be proud to hear that November Project put three teams of [#GrassrootsGear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilVXLuWn2jc) onto the podium to \u201csweep\u201d the event.\n\nSo why I am telling you all this? Because I want to know, _What is the next race that you\u2019re training for?_ [Remember this post](http://november-project.com/hailing-amtrack-trains-for-life/)? What are YOU training for? Even though the answer is sometimes \u201cLIFE\u201d, there are many race opportunities that can put your name and result on the results-board to stack you up against your fellow humans. Just like our PR day every last Wednesday of the month, when scores are being posted our fast and fun racers of all speeds seep to give it an even harder push. \n\nBojan and I took a look at one another a month ago and committed to making this summer a giant step in our training by signing up for every single [Endurance Challenge](http://www.thenorthface.com/en_US/endurance-challenge/?stop_mobi=yes). This will give a purpose to all the hill, stair, and cross-country-off-road training that we\u2019ve been doing and will continue to do throughout the year. We\u2019ve also made the Wisconsin race site the gathering for the [November Project Leader\u2019s Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuzbhgkl73U) where each of the co-leaders in each of the cities around North America will gather the way we did in Edmonton last December.\n\nNow we want to invite you to join us. Sign up for one race or sign up for a race each month all summer and fall long if you want. You\u2019ll find more purpose in your training and more arenas to show off your new fitness levels. Sign up for something that freaks you out a little bit. Run the trail 5k, or a 10k. Grab three teammates and help us takeover the next relay. Options are endless. \n\nWe know that the boys and gals that were racing with us up and down the Bear Mountain as well as the many who have FOMO\u2019d their way into fresh verbals are already gearing up for the [Washington D.C.](http://www.thenorthface.com/en_US/endurance-challenge/washington-dc/?stop_mobi=yes) version of last weekend\u2019s experience. We all know that Danny, Steve and the rest of the D.C. tribe will overtake the event. But for the rest of you\u2026 do I smell a road trip?

The person that is in the back of the line sprints up to the front breaking up the long hike up the hill into smaller higher intensity intervals. Once at the front, that person will slow down to a normal running pace waiting for their buddy/pal/best friend from the team to sprint out to the front.

If you think it\u2019s weird or silly, you probably wont come back, but if you share our stupid sense of humor, you\u2019ll come back again, and you\u2019ll accidentally get fit. \n\nOn [Friday](/summit-ave/), our friends Micah and Grace will host the last Summit Ave Pool Party of 2014. As the weather is getting colder and the school is just around the corner, our generous host wont be able to throw any more of these exclusive socials so they\u2019re looking to have one last hoorah of the season. Who gets to attend will be disclosed on Friday morning, so you\u2019ll just have to come to see if you\u2019re eligible to participate.

For those who couldn\u2019t make it, you\u2019ll just have to read along, close your eyes and imagine the vibe of 4 timezones moving at once in their \u201ctwo by two\u201d formation.

[#BETTERTHANBEDTIME](http://november-project.com/better-than-bedtime-august-17th-2014/) was some funky shit. Though, we probably should have called it #BETTERTHAN**NAP**TIME out here on the West Coast. A 2pm start? I\u2019ve usually been awake for over an hour by 2pm on a Sunday. Regardless, [NPSF](http://november-project.com/san-francisco-ca/) ran through two concerts, did a pit-stop at our favorite newspaper NOT to cover us yet, and dropped a 5 minute flash-mob style workout in Union Square. We were in SO many random tourists\u2019 home videos, we confirmed SO many San Francisco stereotypes, and we drank SO much free beer courtesy of [Bitters Bock & Rye](http://bittersbockandrye.com/); your official November Project San Francisco drinking establishment. Were we the only tribe of 17 to get our bartender to verbal? I\u2019m pretty confident that\u2019s a yes. Did he #STORMTHEFORT with us this morning? That\u2019s definitely a yes. Needless to say, we survived the flood. Long live #NPSF. Oh, and I\u2019ll get a photo or two up here in a second\u2026 for now, here\u2019s Laura doing something normal in Europe.\u201d -Dan Clayton\n\n**Los Angeles Notes:** \u201cIn short LA knew we were celebrating on Sunday! We all met at Plummer park and started the race with a little limbo action. Running through the streets if Hollywood we cause a ruckus at most street corners and even through the McDonald\u2019s on La brea. A hug collision with tourist went down on Hollywood blvd as we made our way to the party spot at Outpost. All and all LA\u2019s first [#BetterThanBedtime](http://november-project.com/better-than-bedtime-august-17th-2014/) was a success.\u201d -Orrin \n\n**Sacramento Notes:** \u201cWe ran from the State Capitol to a local restaurant/pub. Had good drinks, food & even had some newbies join us.  \nI even got my boyfriend to be a cat with me.\u201d -Haley\n\n**San Diego Notes:** \u201cSo it may not have actually rained here in SD, but it was hot enough to elicit some serious precipitation\u2026 I mean perspiration. We had animals, cowboys, a wedding party and 5 Eugene\u2019s to fill up our Ark. Saved from the Great Flood, our tribe exuberantly showed up this morning still decked out in costume \u2013 bc who doesn\u2019t want to dress up on Monday!\u201d \u2013 Jessie\n\n**Edmonton Notes:** \u201cI took naps both before and after this 5k loop with post-run drinks. I can confirm that #BetterThanBedtime was better than either of those naps.\u201d -Nadim\n\n**Denver Notes:** \u201cAt precisely 10 minutes until #BetterThanBedtime, the heavens opened on Denver and spewed giant rain bullets all over the land. But then, Noah took off his shirt, put on his bathrobe and said, \u201cLet\u2019s fuckin party\u201d. Day one of Beervember Project \u2013 Denver was a huge success. The tribe likes to imbibe together while playing giant Jenga and groping each others costumes.\u201d -Dan Turbo\n\n**Minneapolis Notes:** \u201cWe pounded concrete, then raised glasses, and pounded those. Celebrating free fitness will be everyday in [MSP.](http://november-project.com/minneapolis-mn/) Because that shit is Better than Bedtime!!\u201d\n\n**Chicago Notes:** \u201cBefore ending up with at Joe\u2019s on Weed St, we tried collecting as many animals as we could from the Lincoln Park Zoo. Wall sits and planks with the rhinos? Check. Pushups with the hyenas? Check. You could\u2019ve said we were on exhibit as people seemed to be more interested in us than the animals. Yes, they took our photos\u2026\u201d -Brent\n\n**Madison Notes:** \u201cIf you\u2019ve never seen an orange and white baby tiger growling at a sixty five inch banana, you weren\u2019t at NP-MSN BTB 2014. That was one of many highlights as Madison\u2019s finest frolicked from historic Bascom Hill, to beautiful Picnic Point, to the always-under-construction-but-still-badass Memorial Union Terrace. The love that oozes out of our group is undeniable and was on clear display; needless to say, passersby were begging for information on just what this \u201cNovember Project\u201d thing was, and yes, verbals were dropped. #greatsuccess\u201d -Ted Gurman\n\n\u201cMSN, met at the Wednesday location atop Bascom, beneath Abe. Marching in pairs we turned many heads jogging along the Lake Mendota path to the tip of Picnic Point. Best outfits would have to go to a pair of Bananas who cut the run a bit short to take a nap on the lake shore. A well deserved nap a day after the pair represented the NP colors for 13.1 in the Madison Mini Marathon. The finish line was a gorgeous sun above the Union Terrace. Biting the rope was discussed, but it would not have felt right without BG \u2013 so see ya\u2019ll in a month!\u201d -Pat Bauch\n\n**Milwaukee Notes:** \u201cWhen your two dads both leave town, your sexy-cool babysitters throw the best parties. Jen, Andy and Marinna (heavy on the \u2018Jen\u2019) had our tribe scavenging all through the city following clues in order to earn their beers. They are join to be in sooooooo much trouble when Schwabe and DG get home\u2026\u201d -DG-Dad\n\n**Indianapolis Notes:** \u201cTwo newbies showed up for the Indy version of #BetterThanBedtime, Nancy and Lauren. We met at the [Indiana War Memorial](http://november-project.com/indianapolis-in/), did a couple #UpAndOvers for good measure and then set out on a 3+ mile running tour of the best stairs Indy has to offer. We ended our jaunt at a local establishment called the Bourbon Street Distillery where many beverages were shared.\u201d\n\n**Boston Notes:** \u201cWe were lucky to lock down a pimp climbing gym that is pretty hard to find in the Middle of Somerville (pretty much North Boston called [Brooklyn Boulders](http://bkbs.brooklynboulders.com/)), our brew friends ([Harpoon Brewery](http://www.harpoonbrewery.com/)), a DJ that my wife says I shouldn\u2019t call sexy, a two-man band called \u201cThe Big20\u2032s\u201d and a few zillion cases of [90+ Cellars](http://www.ninetypluscellars.com/story/) wine (so that Bojan\u2019s wife would be happy). It was strong, it was funny, it was far [#BetterThanBedtime.](http://november-project.com/better-than-bedtime-august-17th-2014/)\n\n**New York City Notes:** \u201cNP_NYC Takes Over Manhattan! We kicked off our 4-mile Manhattan take-over at our Wednesday home, [Gracie Mansion](http://november-project.com/new-york-ny/). From Gracie we took over Central Park, Grand Army Plaza, famous 5th Ave, a Madison Avenue street fair, all the way to Park Avenue Tavern. Burpees, planks, and hosties along the way. We owned NYC and shit got messy!

When you\u2019re part of the #NP_BAL wolfpack, people are always gonna stare. But Sunday evening as penguins and dinosaurs, tigers and power rangers, all chased Noah through\u200b \u200bthe streets and parks of Baltimore\u200b,\u200b those were stares of envy.

Notes:** \u201cThe tribe is strong. The tribe is wonderfully weird. But most importantly, the tribe is changing a city, a nation, a world. A few minor casualties, some sweaty costumes, and a few beers later, we are stronger (and weirder) than ever. Onward DC #HiFiveCity #SmileFactory.\u201d -Steve\n\n**Philadelphia Notes:** \u201cBeginning at Love Park, [November Project Philadelphia](http://november-project.com/philadelphia-pa/) traversed just shy of 4 miles of _The City of Brotherly Love_, donning paired costumes and #grassrootsgear. The Ark safely docked at the Field House where cold drinks flowed and good times were had.\n\n**New Orleans Notes:** \u201cAfter a counting two by two, and some jello shots, to load the ark at Montiero Park, the NP_NO tribe cast off down the St Charles Avenue neutral ground. Noah himself and Kate with the bike mounted tunes led unicorns, Indians, salt & pepper shakers, and an assorted menagerie as the tribe worked its way to Fat Harry\u2019s bar mid-course. After dodging a few streetcars, the group stopped, had a beer or two, and then pressed on to Jefferson avenue and back to complete the route. The voyage ended at The Bulldog where what felt like 40 day/nights worth of beer and king cake vodka shots were consumed. Clear eyes, full hearts, and pounding headaches this morning\u2026 Can\u2019t lose. It was awesome, we love this tribe!\u201d -Preston\n", "title": "#BetterThanBedtime 2014 from West to East: The Event Recap", "url": "http://november-project.com/betterthanbedtime-2014-from-west-to-east-the-event-recap/", "workout_entry": true, "author": "brogan", "location": "POINT (-71.0635000000000048 42.3581000000000003)", "date": "2014-08-20", "dow": 2}, "model": "novproj.post", "pk": 374}, {"fields": {"body": "Earlier this summer, one of our #DestinationDeck locations was in Lower Allston by the canoe dock that\u2019s operated by [Charles River Canoe & Kayak](http://www.paddleboston.com/main.php) (CRCK).

Put lay the concept out as simple as possible: All cities will execute a Sunday summer race/run/destination party called #BetterThanBedtime that will lead participants to an unknown location to drink, party, and have an OK time. \n\nThe detailed concept is this: There is a destination party that none of your tribe members know of except the co-leaders. With respective meeting areas and we, as co-leaders, guide the giant group run across town to the hidden destination, usually a bar or drinking space, to socialize with all of these good people we may or may not have had enough time to get to know during our quick morning workouts. The run in each city will be between 5K and 5M give or take a few miles. The party should last between 2 and 20 hours give or take a few. \n\nWhat makes this event special is that we\u2019ll all be moving at the **exact time** in our cities as we head to these mystery destinations.

Usually one of the parents stays home to take care of the little ones, while the other one comes to run the stairs, crush some hills, roll around in the mud, sprint in the snow, or swim in the Boston Harbor. How parenting duties are divided we wont go into details as the complexity of negotiations, and bargaining chips used, should be a blog post itself. But one thing that we don\u2019t hear all that much about is what November Project is doing for the inner-marital competition. Our friend Erika Anderson, shares her insights\u2026  \n_  \nLast week I attended all three November Project sessions: burpees at City Hall Plaza (where were YOU, Mayor Walsh?), PR day at the stadium (posing with the #PR_Pig), dinosaurs on Summit (dressed as mammal, not reptile). This, however, is par for the course for hundreds in our city, not to mention the rest of the United States. It is, actually, par for the course in my own house. My husband has been attending November Project religiously \u2013 one even may say cultishly \u2013 since first reading about it in Runner\u2019s World last November. For months, I\u2019ve heard tales of burpees in the snow, shovels on Summit, PR\u2019s at Harvard. A third of his laundry is spray painted, and we even have a stroller that sports the NP logo.\n\nStacking three days of NP under my belt was an accomplishment not so much for the physical achievement as for the attitude adjustment it afforded me. You see, my husband I used to run together. On our second, kind-of date (a year after our first kind-of dat\u2026but that\u2019s another story), he went running with me in golf  \ncleats\u2026because they beat running in dress shoes from the previous night\u2019s wedding. I signed up for my first marathon because, well, he did, and wasn\u2019t I was in better shape than he was? We racked up a collection of medals from various 5K\u2019s, 10K\u2019s, and half marathons. We carefully researched and selected a jogging stroller (Bob Revolution for any new parents out there), and we posed giddily next to our daughter in the stroller when she went on her first run. Later, when our family expanded to three girls, we took \u201cfamily\u201d runs, and became the people hogging the running paths that everyone hates.\n\nOn one such run, my oldest daughter, looking far down the block at my husband pushing the double stroller, asked, \u201cIs Daddy the fastest man in the world?\u201d I smiled (or grimaced) and said, \u201cNo honey, he\u2019s not.\u201d My amusement at her believed-to-be daddy worship was dashed when she responded, \u201cWell, then catch up to him.\u201d\n\nHe beat me that day, but the truth is, for over a decade, my husband and I ran together and generally, I beat him. Not because I\u2019m necessarily faster but because I trained harder and, as he would say, have more \u201cmental toughness.\u201d If, by mental toughness, he\u2019s referring to my deep-seated, nearly pathological competitive nature, then yes, I would agree. Whatever the reason, for years, I could beat my husband.\n\nThat is, until November Project entered the relationship. NP not only gave him rock hard abs, defined delts (try doing a deck of cards with a two-year old on your back), and the ability to do seven minutes of burpees, but it also gave him a commitment and motivation I had not seen before and that, frankly, I envied. In the dark, bitter cold of the polar vortex, he would, unfailingly roll out of bed, layer on the technical gear, and head out the door to get faster and stronger.\n\nMy resentment grew. I could not longer compete with him, and I certainly couldn\u2019t compete with a pack of happy huggers ready to rip into a morning workout. So, as the old adage says, if you can\u2019t beat \u2018em, join \u2018em! After signing up for the Heartbreak Hill half marathon, I claimed NP Fridays. After all, Summit is a short run from our house, and would be the motivation I needed to prepare for the hills of the race course. I knew I needed something extra \u2013 like a giant hill, some zany leaders, and a hundred plus others every Friday \u2013 to get me there. In short, I drank the Kool-Aid my husband offered me.\n\nAlthough I remained true to my verbals, I did not like it. Truth be told, I hate early mornings, I hate hugs, and I hate socializing before a cup of coffee. Any pleasure I derived from whispering the f-bomb every Friday ended about a third of the way up the Hill and was totally forgotten when we ran those f-ing stairs. But, sometime after the half marathon (where I was mighty close to a PR), I actually started taking some pleasure in running the Hill. I found myself able to pick people off in the ascent. To finish four fulls and not want to collapse. I even found myself running there, alone, on a hot Tuesday afternoon when I missed the Friday workout. If I didn\u2019t watch out, pretty soon, I, too, would be spray-painting my clothing.\n\nAfter one such Friday workout, I told my husband that I was in the top handful of women. He was skeptical, and started throwing around names of the really speedy ladies. I don\u2019t know names (do people actually remember the names of the people they hug?), I simply watched finishes. And then \u2013 [the pool party was announced](/its-a-pool-party-in-boston/). The top twenty people got to splash in a neighbor\u2019s pool post work out. Despite my husband\u2019s palpable desire to race that morning, Fridays were mine, and I was psyched about the prospect of the pool. That morning, the top 8 men and top 12 women would go to the pool. I ran hard, and made the cut\u2026or should I say splash. My husband was proud of my chlorinated sweat the way only another crazy NP\u2019er could be.\n\nAnd so, the next week, when family came to visit and could watch the kids, I joined my husband for all three NP sessions. I didn\u2019t care that I could barely keep up with him on the way to City Hall Plaza. I loved that he had long completed the stadium by the time I reached section 1 \u2013 he created a little cheering section just for me. We had fun posing with the pig. And on Friday, I returned to Summit and actually socialized \u2013 with a dinosaur \u2013 long before my first cup of coffee.\n\nA week of NP reminded me that running together is an important part of our relationship. How we run together has changed, yet at its core, it\u2019s the same: something that connects us, that drives us to be better, where we simultaneously support and strive to outdo one another. Like a good marriage, when we run, we start together, we take the same path, and we end up in the same place. Whether we run that path side by side or encourage the other to finish, we are better partners for pushing each other to get there. We are better partners for hugging each other before we do much of anything else.\n\nIt\u2019s true, that because of November Project, I can no longer beat my husband. But because of November Project, I no longer care so much about whether I do. And besides \u2013 I\u2019ll always have the pool party.\n", "title": "If You Can\u2019t Beat \u2018em, Join \u2018em \u2013 Guest Post by Erika", "url": "http://november-project.com/if-you-cant-beat-em-join-em-guest-post-by-erika/", "workout_entry": true, "author": "bojan", "location": "POINT (-71.0635000000000048 42.3581000000000003)", "date": "2014-08-07", "dow": 3}, "model": "novproj.post", "pk": 386}, {"fields": {"body": "Before I talk about the workout, I\u2019d like to this opportunity to apologize to some of you for the comments I made this morning when presenting the [#PositivityAward](/positivity-award/) to our good friend Dana Panepinto. In the heat of the moment when presenting something that we care so much about, I said that people that commute outside of Boston should \u201cShut the Fuck Up\u201d about their commutes as our boy Dana is commuting every Monday-Wednesday-Friday from Falmouth. For those of you not familiar with Massachusetts, Falmouth is on Cape Cod (a solid 80 minute long drive without any traffic). \n\nIn my presentation, it may appear that my comments were directed at people that come to our workouts. After reviewing the video few times it certainly looked that way to me, so I\u2019d assume that there will be at least one person sharing my sentiments. So I want to set things straight. My comment was not directed at a single person that ever came to November Project workout. For over two years I never heard anyone complaining about their commute regardless of how far/long it may be. We have people that are coming from as far as New Hampshire or Road Island and they **NEVER** complain. They all show up with a smile and determination on their face answering the \u201cYou good?\u201d question the only proper way. To all of you NP commuters and travelers I want to say that I am sorry. My comment was a result of many online inquires from people that never come before because they live in far away places like Waltham, Quincy, or Arlington, just to name the few. My comment was directed at people that suggested that we should start satellite tribes in aforementioned areas so they can start attending. My comment was directed at all those same people as they wouldn\u2019t come even if the workout was outside of their house. Then they would say it\u2019s too cold, too hot, too [fill in the blank]. My comment, the way it was delivered was passionate but silly, so from now on I\u2019ll leave all the announcements to BG. \n\nDana Panepinto, you\u2019re the fucking man!

[#Frogman1](/frogman1/) is all about doing 50 sections. Sometimes we start at section 37, work our way to section 13, repeat 13 and head back to 37. Sometimes we do a full tour (37 sections) and then tack on extra 13 sections just for good measure. And sometimes we just do 10 sections 5 times. This morning we did it all. We split the group into racers, newbies, and everyone else. Our racers did the classic 37-13-13-37. The newbies completed introductory 1/2 tour a.k.a. 19 sections. And everyone else, like a typewriter, covered sections 10-1, 5 times with the light jog in between. This last options was particularly useful for the folks that are working their way up to completing 50 sections as it gives them the opportunity to do a scalable version of 40 or 30 sections. \n\nThis morning was fierce.

The reason we do 40 sections is because nobody does 40 sections. Nobody trains with hundreds of newly born \u201cmorning people\u201d who prefer hugs over handshakes. We train 40 sections because at the end of the tour you have three opportunities to race with the pack that has collected at section 1. Those last three sections can also be seen as opportunities to impress the fast kids who are watching you from above. 40 sections will also make the last Wednesday in April* feel like a breeze. \n\nThere were many new faces in the group today who worked their way to the middle of the stadium and capped off their morning with a 1/2 tour. For those of you who were with us as newbies today we hope that you\u2019re aiming to finish your first full tour in the next few weeks. Nice work today. \n\n**PACK YOUR BABY**: At November Project we have very few excuses that actually have value. Being sick or cold or tired usually don\u2019t cut it. The few that have gotten both Bojan and I to give people who we\u2019re recruiting just a little bit of slack are as follows\u2026 \u201c[I just signed a deal to play pro hockey in the Czech Republic and the commute may be too expensive each week](http://espn.go.com/nhl/story/_/id/8460881/nhl-playing-czech-republic-lockout-old-times-andrew-ference),\u201d \u201cI severed my head a few days ago and am having it reattached,\u201d and \u201cMy babies keep me at home a lot.\u201d As of today, the BABY excuse is no longer acceptable. Yes, coming from two dudes who don\u2019t have kids you may think this is beyond bold. But what started with Nicole last August in a [BABYBJORN](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmndaOQAKhQ) has continued on. Today we had our second mama-baby-seat-climbing combo training with us. No excuses, be more badass, think about this badass mama when you rise and shine. \n\n**FRIDAY**: We will race [these hills](http://november-project.com/summit-ave/) with our friends from [STRAVA](http://www.strava.com/). Between now and then it will be helpful to download their app onto your smart phone \u2013 You\u2019ll see on Friday. Oh, and please follow the Chris Marshal Rule and park your 4-wheelers anywhere but Summit Ave (legally of course). Last week was great until [Claire Wood fucked it all up](http://november-project.com/gathering-monday-np_yoga4/). Keep Summit clear **PLEASE**.\n\n**MARCH SHOES**: They are coming. Stay cool.

The last 7 weeks have been thrown around with random snow/ice days, track workouts, and football practices. Aim your sights on [Wednesday, April 24th](http://november-project.com/stadium/) as the day you post your absolute fastest time for 37 sections. For many of you this will mean racing to complete your first full tour of 37 sections \u2013 a great goal. Know that the only score we\u2019re recording and posting for the entire month of April will be that morning. Train hard until that day and come ready to race. For you racers out there, this will be a great way to have your first solid 2013 score to break over and over throughout Spring, Summer, and Fall. Its cool to do 1,000 sections but its cooler to post PR\u2019s. Are you under 30 minutes? 25 minutes (Goldie)? 23 minutes (Sara Wild)? Under 18 minutes (BG)? Get faster. Stay hydrated.

Bottom to top distance is little under 1/2 mile (.4 miles to be exact) of steepness and pain. Gradient varies from hard (~7%-8%) to my lungs are burning (~15%-16%) and it takes us anywhere from 3-4 minutes on average to get up there. Below is the gradient chart borrowed from MapMyRun website that illustrates the elevation. All that purple means that this hill is pretty serious.\n\nWe meet on the corner of Summit ave Beacon St at 6:45am every Friday and run up and down the hill 5 times. Workout is great and it can last anywhere from 30-45 minutes depending on the rest in between the pieces and the jogging time down the hill.\n\nKay, Bojan and Brogan were on the scene today. We expected more names to show up but they got lost in the fog that was covering Boston area this morning. Kay wanted to do 3 sets of sprints as a part of her run to the hill and back, but ended up doing all 5. She\u2019s a soldier! Speaking of soldiers, after narrowly escaping death by a cab door while riding his bike on the Mass ave last week, Brogan showed up to cheer the troops and take some photos and videos. His bum knee is still not ready to take the beating of the hill but we\u2019re sure that he\u2019ll be back in action soon.

Some will argue that this system is [wrong, corrupt, and obsolete](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/01/07/dont-expect-a-new-movie-ratings-system-in-2014), and our opinion on this matter is not all that important for this blog post. What\u2019s important is the fact that today November Project added 17th city (and the last one of 2014) to our always expanding family and unlike MPAA, we\u2019re allowing everyone to join the fun regardless of their age or fitness levels. To celebrate addition of Chicago to #NP17, here in Boston we had an amazing workout commonly known as the Firedrill. Special thanks to Scott for helping with the start and today\u2019s photos, congrats to Kelvin Ma on winning the [#PositivityAward](/positivity-award/) and happy birthday to everyone that was born on May 14th! \n\nBut enough about us \u2013 ladies and gentleman I\u2019m proud to present November Project Chicago! \n\n**CHICAGO NOTES**:\n\nTo say that the workout this morning was hyped is an understatement. You could just sense something was different, and it showed while we were crushing hills like bros crush beers. After a crazy-fast time trial up the sledding hill, we knocked out a burpee-laiden pyramid next to lake. The scene was out of control. We finished with a million hugs, a few groupies, and one epic self-intro on the lakefront. \u201cChicago, are you good? FUCK YEAH!\u201d\n\nCheck out more [details on NP_CHI](/chicago-il/) and make sure to follow us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/NovemberProjectCHI) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Nov_ProjectCHI).\n", "title": "This Tribe is Rated #NP17", "url": "http://november-project.com/this-tribe-is-rated-np17/", "workout_entry": true, "author": "bojan", "location": "POINT (-71.0635000000000048 42.3581000000000003)", "date": "2014-05-14", "dow": 2}, "model": "novproj.post", "pk": 403}, {"fields": {"body": "Our group photo this morning was slightly different than the usual straight face, straight back pose that\u2019s always causing a fight on who\u2019s going to sit in the front row, or who\u2019s going to make the cut in the first 50 tags on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/NovProject) (you know that you can repost that same photo on your profile and tag yourself as much as you want?).

Yeah, me neither. But luckily we write blog posts that, after a while go into archives, that can be easily accessed though your smart phones that have the data plan, but you have to have at least two signal bars for it to work, otherwise that one bar will make you wait 5 minutes to download one photo. Or you can access our blog post archives through your computer that is connected to the internet via cable that plugs in the back panel, or the side panel, or through the wireless signal receiver that\u2019s built into the computer, so you don\u2019t have to use the cables.

But I digress\u2026\n\nThrough (as demonstrated above, not so simple) search of the dusty archives of the gong-show that [November Project Blog](http://november-project.com/category/blog/) is, I managed to find the post that I wrote last time our #DestinationDeck [location was in Southie](http://november-project.com/oceanic-destinationdeck/). Like this morning, 13 months ago, we jumped on the wall \u201cas a warm-up\u201d, but instead of beach sprints, this morning we did 7 minutes of burpees. I bet that no-one saw that little surprise, especially since we just did 7 minutes of burpees not that long ago. \n\nSpeaking of surprises, my phone \u201csurprised\u201d me by telling me that there is a VERY good chance of rain showers on Wednesday.
